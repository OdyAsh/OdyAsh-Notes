# Promotion Focus Vs Prevention Focus

([source](https://youtu.be/N5HQaVy85s0?t=556))

Promotion-focused individuals are **motivated by the pursuit of goals and positive outcomes**, while prevention-focused individuals are **motivated by the avoidance of negative outcomes and potential losses**.

Promotion focus refers to a motivational state in which an individual is driven by the pursuit of positive outcomes and is focused on achieving goals. Promotion-focused individuals tend to be optimistic and willing to take risks in pursuit of their goals.

Prevention focus, on the other hand, refers to a motivational state in which an individual is driven by the avoidance of negative outcomes and is focused on preventing losses. Prevention-focused individuals tend to be more cautious and risk-averse, and they may be more likely to engage in defensive behaviors to avoid negative outcomes.
