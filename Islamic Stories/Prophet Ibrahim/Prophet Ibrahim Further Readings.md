# Ibrahim's Family
Check [this](https://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/understanding-islam/the-bible-and-the-quran-on-abraham-and-his-sons/) article to know how the family of Ibrahim (a.s) was mentioned in the Quran and in the Bible.
Excerpts:
> So in his old age, God’s promise to Abraham had been doubly fulfilled. Through Abraham’s second son, Isaac, came the Israelite prophets, including Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus (peace be upon them all). This fulfillment of God’s promise through the Israelite branch is made abundantly clear in the Bible.
...
> Although hardly mentioned, because it didn’t fit in with the Israelite view of its own history and destiny, God’s promise is _also_ fulfilled through the Ishmaelite branch.
...
> Although the Israelite branch has chosen through history to ignore the claims of the first-born son, Ishmael (peace be upon him), claiming that he was not legitimate and therefore had no rights, it is clear from the Bible alone that Hagar was Abraham’s wife.
...
> Putting aside any bias, this shows that there is a clear connection between Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
