## "Change in..."

When we say "the change in something", we mean the difference between the final state and the beginning state of that something.

For example, in displacement vectors, when we define a displacement vector $\vec r$ as "the change $\nabla$ in the position vector ${r}_{i}$ of an object", we can represent that as:

$$ \nabla\vec{r}=\vec{r}_2-\vec{r}_1$$
