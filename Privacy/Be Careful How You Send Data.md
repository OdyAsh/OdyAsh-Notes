# Sending Images Over WhatsApp

Source: ChatGPT:

To protect user privacy, WhatsApp automatically removes the Exif metadata from images before sending them over the app. This means that any sensitive information contained in the metadata will not be shared along with the image.

WhatsApp removes the Exif metadata from images by default when they are sent over the app.

However, **there may be cases where the Exif metadata is not removed, such as when an image is edited using a third-party app that does not remove the metadata or when sending an image through WhatsApp Web instead of the mobile app. In such cases, the metadata may still be present in the image and could be accessible to the recipient**.

Therefore, while WhatsApp itself removes the Exif metadata by default, it is still important to be aware of the potential for metadata to be retained and to take steps to remove it if necessary to protect your privacy.
