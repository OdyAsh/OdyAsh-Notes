# OdyAsh-Notes - A Host for my Second Brain
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes ranging from Programming and file management to Islamic topics :]

Currently, the quickest way for you to access this vault is by [searching the files through GitHub itself](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61471327/13626137) (although the markdown files aren't formatted on GitHub as well as Obsidian) 

Alternatively (and this the better option), you can access the vault by:

1. [Installing](https://obsidian.md/download) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
   1. Side note: To see awesome [digital gardens](https://publish.obsidian.md/dakotamurray/2.00+-+Wiki/general/Digital+Gardening) that people like you and me made, you can see their hosted websites [here](https://obsidian.md/publish#:~:text=Explore%20Publish%20sites%20by%20the%20Obsidian%20community) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/18wl8ao/i_wanna_know_of_more_examples_of_blogs_made_using/).

3. Cloning this repository to your local machine

4. Extracting the zip file to a folder (this folder is called an `Obsidian Vault`)

5. Opening the vault in Obsidian

Side note: I wanted to try [this method](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages#How%20to%20publish%20Obsidian%20notes%20with%20Quartz%20on%20GitHub%20Pages) for you to access the vault, but I currently don't have time...
