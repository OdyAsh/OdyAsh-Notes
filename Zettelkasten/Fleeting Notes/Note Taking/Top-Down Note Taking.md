top-down note-taking ([s1](https://kmltkc.medium.com/the-actual-work-is-not-taking-notes-obsidian-22030d172f91#94a7)):
* Opposite of [Bottom-Up Note Taking](Bottom-Up%20Note%20Taking.md)
* You start at the top with a certain topic, idea, or flexible goal in mind. 
* It might be vague at the moment but maybe something worth pursuing further.

Top-down note-taking follows the steps:

1. Defining a thought
2. Do the research
3. Thinking, understanding, taking notes, and connecting them
4. Writing more specifically

Here, a thought or an idea is the starting point.
