bottom-up note-taking ([s1](https://kmltkc.medium.com/the-actual-work-is-not-taking-notes-obsidian-22030d172f91#edbd)):
* Opposite of [Top-Down Note Taking](Top-Down%20Note%20Taking.md)
* starts with taking notes and connecting notes at “the bottom”. 
* You keep taking notes and connecting them until clusters of notes emerge. 
	* These clusters emerge from the bottom of your note up.
* is a great way to avoid writer’s block. 
	* You just look at the emerging clusters and in an instance, you can pull up a bunch of connected notes to think and write about.

Bottom-up note-taking follows the steps:

1. Doing research
2. Thinking, understanding, taking notes, and connecting them
3. Discovering interesting clusters
4. Writing more specifically
