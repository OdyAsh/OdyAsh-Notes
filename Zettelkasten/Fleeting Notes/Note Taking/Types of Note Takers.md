There are four different types of note-takers ([s1](https://obsidian.rocks/maps-of-content-effortless-organization-for-notes/#What_is_a_digital_garden), [s3](https://www.mentorist.app/action/choose-a-notetaking-app-based_373/#:~:text=Evaluate%20your%20notetaking%20style%20and,lists%20and%20compiling%20useful%20resources.)). They are:

- The architect
	- you prefer organizing, inventing, and creating your own systems.
- The gardener
	-  you prefer linking your ideas and expanding concepts.
- The librarian
	- you love making lists and compiling useful resources.
	- similar with the architect, but focuses more on projects ([s5](https://medium.com/@mohdnazrein10/the-four-notetaking-archetype-2d4ab2ea9f19)).
		- The research and data are collected for a specific project and learning for a particular theme of subject
- Student
	- you use your notes for short-term goals, such as writing a paper or taking a test.

In a nutshell, architects like to _plan_, gardeners like to _cultivate_, and librarians like to _collect_.
