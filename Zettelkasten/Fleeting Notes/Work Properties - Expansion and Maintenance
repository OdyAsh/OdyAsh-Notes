Any work has one of these 2 states (or both, but by different members!):

* Project 
  * Expansion phase
  * Has a start an end date.
  * Example 1: Building an apartment
  * Example 2: Creating a new big feature in a software project.
  * KPIs: valued increments of a new feature (when they get delivered, rate of errors, etc.), etc.
* Operations
  * Maintenance phase
  * Continuous
  * Example 1: Maintaining an apartment
  * Example 2: Monthly ingestion of data in a data-focused project.
  * KPIs: outages, recovery time, running costs.
