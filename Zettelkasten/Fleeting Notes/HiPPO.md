# HiPPO - Highest Paid Person Opinion

* A HiPPO is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">someone who is perceived to have more “authority”</mark> about how to improve your product (s1).
	* HiPPOs are subjective and unscientific – in fact, they are “emblematic of large, [autocratic](../../Personal%20Dictionary/en-US/Autocratic%20vs%20Authoritarian.md) organizations instead of smaller, more democratic startups.” (s2)
* The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">HiPPO effect</mark> states that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the opinion of the highest paid person is given more consideration</mark> in a decision because it has a higher value per se (s3).
