# Personal Tips about Obsidian Community Plugins

## Remember Cursor vs Navigate Cursor History

I personally found issues when using the "Remember Cursor" plugin (e.g., clicking on a backlink for a certain header in another page leads me to the last cursor position of that other page, instead of the header that I wanted to focus on), but I didn't find these issues in "Navigate Cursor" plugin.

However, massive respect to both developers either way!

# Meaning of Highlight Colors

#highlighting

First of all, I'm referring to this Obsidian community plugin: [Highlightr](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin).

Second of all, I want you to imagine this analogy for understanding information: Each topic can have its information's sub-topics spread out like a tree, where: 
* Its roots are the most fundamental info that is essential for:
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">understanding this topic</mark> (tree), 
	* or for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">understanding in general</mark> (i.e., a very useful info to know).
* The branches are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">information that "connect the dots"</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">where some of these branches are tricky and difficult to understand</mark>, but understanding them will help us connect the dots either with other info :\].
* The leaves are: 
	* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">by-products</mark> of the topic mentioned in this information. I.e., they don't have to connect to other branches (i.e., sub-topics) in the current tree (i.e., topic); some of them are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">really cool</mark> btw :\].
	* or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">points of connections to different topics</mark>.
		* Side note: I know leaves don't connect to other trees, so let's just imagine a bunch of trees next to each other, so that by "connecting to other trees", I actually mean "overlapping on other trees" :\].

Now of course, to refer this information, we use specific domain-related <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">terminologies</mark>. 

Example of such a tree is [Margie Hale's](https://www2.stetson.edu/~mhale/logic/tree.htm)Â pure Math tree found in [Mathematics](../Sciences/Formal%20Sciences/Mathematics/Mathematics.md#Mind%20Maps%20of%20Mathematics) note:

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240123045858.png)

Side note: the yellow/orange/green fruits above don't represent the highlights above or below; they are explained in the [math](../Sciences/Formal%20Sciences/Mathematics/Mathematics.md#Mind%20Maps%20of%20Mathematics) note.

Now, returning to the meaning of the highlights I make throughout my notes:

Unfortunately, I'm not consistent with the meaning behind each highlight color I use. So hopefully, I'll stick to the meanings below from now on :\]. The order below is from lowest importance to highest importance (kind of). Also, the meanings below are kind of synonyms to the meanings mentioned above (about the tree, etc.).

* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Grey</mark>: Information that I find useful for me specifically. In other words, info that I want to highlight for myself; it doesn't have to be important to you or to the topic.
	* Hex code: `#CACFD9A6`
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cyan</mark>: Used to indicate a "huh, interesting" kind of information.
	* Hex code: `#ABF7F7A6`
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Blue</mark>: Same as cyan, but like, "huh, very cool" kind of information :\].
	* Hex code: `#ADCCFFA6`
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green</mark>: Information that usually refers to other topics.
	* Hex code: `#BBFABBA6`
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Yellow</mark>: Introducing a new terminology/jargon/keyword related to a specific topic. Most likely, you'll see me #tagging  these keywords as well as highlighting them in yellow.
	* Hex code: `#FFF3A3A6`
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Pink</mark>: Important info that will usually help you understand other info related to the current topic.
	* Hex code: `#FFB8EBA6`
* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Purple</mark>: Same as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>, but this information is usually tricky/difficult to understand, or hard to memorize.
	* Hex code: `#D2B3FFA6`
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orange</mark>: Very important info for understanding the current topic.
	* Hex code: `#FFB86CA6`
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Red</mark>: Very important info that is useful for the current topic, in other topics, or in your life :\].
	* Hex code: `#FF5582A6`

Of course, the info that I highlight is completely subjective. For example, I may highlight something with <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">red</mark>, even though you may think it's not important to you, and I may highlight something with <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">grey</mark>, and it turns out to be important to you.

Pro-tip: If you're running obsidian locally, you can `ctrl+shift+f` the colors' hex codes to see examples of each highlight color.
