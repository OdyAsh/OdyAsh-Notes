# Publishing using Quartz 4.0

Sources:

[article (with video)](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) that considers private files, [main guide](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started) (from Quartz website itself)

Fun fact: 
* I've discovered Quartz from [Data Glossary (glossary.airbyte.com)](https://glossary.airbyte.com//), 
	* which was mentioned in [this](https://medium.pimpaudben.fr/data-engineer-is-a-transitional-job-ed0074c89646) article by [Benoit Pimpaud](https://medium.pimpaudben.fr/), 
		* which I found by searching on Google with the following term: "[shell scripting for data engineers medium](https://www.google.com/search?q=shell+scripting+for+data+engineers+medium&oq=shell+scripting+for+data+engineers+medium&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigAdIBCDYyMDZqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#ip=1)",
			* which I searched for because I was following "sprint 1" of [this](https://anujsyal.com/a-step-by-step-roadmap-to-data-engineering) article by [Anuj Syal](https://hashnode.com/@anujsyal),
				* Which I read because I was confused on where to start learning Data Engineering concepts in a coherent way.
					* Which I needed to study for my position at VOIS EG.
