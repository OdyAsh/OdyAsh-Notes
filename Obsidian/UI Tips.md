# Automatically update links to headers when these are renamed

[Issue description's source](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/automatically-update-links-to-headers-when-these-are-renamed/61942)

Current workaround solution ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/y6r152/comment/isr1k23/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)): need to right click the heading inside a document and choose "rename" option.
