Stages of Product Development Life Cycle:

1.  Brainstorm:

-   Active discovery stage
-   **Generate ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges**
-   Identify needs or challenges the audience may have
-   **UX researchers and writers heavily involved**
-   Conduct interviews with potential users or conduct other research

2.  Define:

-   Use insights from the brainstorm stage
-   Start to narrow the focus
-   **Determine concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user**
-   **Outline the goals or problems you want to answer with the product design**

3.  Design:

-   UX designers actively develop ideas
-   Check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic
-   Generate designs that keep the user top of mind
-   **Create storyboards, wireframes, prototypes**
-   Ensure designs are practical and functional

4.  Test:

-   Evaluate product design based on feedback from potential users
-   Identify areas to refine or improve designs
-   **Consider interactivity of the design**
-   **Interaction between UX designers and front-end engineers**

5.  Launch:

-   **Sharing a finished version of the product with the public**
-   List an app in the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store, make a website go live, or put a physical product on store shelves
-   Chance to understand how designs will be received in the real world
-   Opportunity to improve on designs or learn even more about the user experience based on feedback

# Characteristics of A Good UX

-   Usability means the design is clear, easy to use, and functional for specific tasks.

-   Enjoyability means the design creates a positive connection with users and delights them.
