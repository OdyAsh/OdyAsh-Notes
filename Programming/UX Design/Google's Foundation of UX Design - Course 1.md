## Graphic vs User Designers
**Graphic** designers usually work on the appearance of a **physical product**, like an invitation or a poster, while **UX** designers **focus on how users interact** with the product.

Stages of Product Development Life Cycle:

1.  Brainstorm:

-   Active discovery stage
-   **Generate ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges**
-   Identify needs or challenges the audience may have
-   **UX researchers and writers heavily involved**
-   Conduct interviews with potential users or conduct other research

2.  Define:

-   Use insights from the brainstorm stage
-   Start to narrow the focus
-   **Determine concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user**
-   **Outline the goals or problems you want to answer with the product design**

3.  Design:

-   UX designers actively develop ideas
-   Check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic
-   Generate designs that keep the user top of mind
-   **Create storyboards, wireframes, prototypes**
-   Ensure designs are practical and functional

4.  Test:

-   Evaluate product design based on feedback from potential users
-   Identify areas to refine or improve designs
-   **Consider interactivity of the design**
-   **Interaction between UX designers and front-end engineers**

5.  Launch:

-   **Sharing a finished version of the product with the public**
-   List an app in the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store, make a website go live, or put a physical product on store shelves
-   Chance to understand how designs will be received in the real world
-   Opportunity to improve on designs or learn even more about the user experience based on feedback

# Characteristics of A Good UX
-   Good UX design has primary characteristics: **usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful**.
-   Usability means the design is clear, easy to use, and functional for specific tasks.
-   <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Equity means the design addresses the needs of diverse groups</mark> and ensures a high-quality experience for all users.
-   Enjoyability means the design creates a positive connection with users and delights them.
-   Usefulness means the design intentionally solves a user problem and adds value to their experience.
-   Examples of great UX design can be found in everyday objects, as highlighted by the Google Design team.

# Specialist Vs Generalist Vs T-Shaped

([source](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/supplement/5O2hO/the-role-of-a-beginner-ux-designer))

-   UX designers can choose to specialize in a certain area or keep their skill set more broad
-   Specialist UX designers focus on one type of design and become experts, while generalist UX designers have a broad range of responsibilities
-   Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies, while generalist positions are more common at companies with fewer UX designers
-   T-shaped designers are specialists with related skills in a broad number of areas
-   Each designer has a natural T-shape in their abilities
-   Developing specific skills can help direct a designer's T-shape and lead to new experiences and professional growth

# Roles in Different Company Sizes

-   UX design roles can vary depending on the company’s size and industry.
-   **Startups** and small businesses offer close-knit teams, opportunities for growth, creativity, and a lot of impact on final products, but fewer mentors, more responsibility, and quicker pace.
-   **Big companies** provide opportunities for growth, mentorship, clearer guidelines, specialization, and working in larger teams, but may feel less impactful or important, may have defined guidelines that can be restrictive to creativity, and may feel small at a company with so many features and products.
-   **Design agencies** offer lots of impact, networking opportunities, exposure to many companies and industries, and potential to work with large brands and display that work in your portfolio, but lack mentorship, may lead to monotony or lack of ownership and finished product.
-   **Advertising agencies** offer autonomy, learning opportunities, variety, and networking, but have a wide variation in projects, may often involve branding and marketing, and might not focus on UX design.
-   **Freelancers** have the freedom to set their own schedule, choose their own work, build their portfolio, and freelance while working another job or balancing competing priorities, but they also have no structure or readily available mentors, less stability, and are responsible for managing the logistics of their own business.
-   To decide where to work, UX designers should consider their preferences for structure and processes, working in teams or alone, focusing on UX design or broadening their skill set.

Consider questions like:

-   Do you enjoy a lot of structure and processes, or do you like to define your own work and schedule? 
    
-   Do you value working on a big team, or are you more comfortable working alone? 
    
-   Do you want to focus mainly on UX design, or are you interested in broadening your skill set? 
    

Considering your career goals and how you work best will help you start to figure out the kind of company that might be the best fit for you.


# Design Thinking Process

Design Thinking: A UX design framework that focuses on the user throughout all five phases:
**empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test**.

noting that "**empathize**": The phase of Design Thinking that involves getting to know your user through
research, and that "**define**": The phase of Design Thinking that involves leveraging the insights gained during the empathize phase to identify the problem you’ll solve with your design --> you should get from this stage a **problem statement**.

User-centered design: Puts the user front-and-center

Framework: Creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve

**Information architecture**: The framework of a website or how it’s organized, categorized, and
structured

# Accessibility Related

* Accessibility: The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities
* Alternative text (alt text): Text that helps translate something visual, such as an image or graph, into a description that can be read by screen readers
* Assistive technology: Any products, equipment, or systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities.
* Color modification: Features that increase the contrast of colors on a screen, like high-contrast mode or dark mode
* Switch device: An assistive technology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse
* **Equality**: Providing the same amount of opportunity and support
* **Equity-focused design**: Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products
* **Inclusive design**: Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender
* **Universal design**: The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations

# Types of Biases

The following are six types of biases:

-   **Confirmation bias**: occurs when you look for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have, and you're drawn to information that confirms your beliefs and preconceptions
-   **False consensus bias**: the assumption that others will think the same way as you do; happens when we overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design, which creates a false consensus
-   **Primacy bias**: when you remember the first participant most strongly; sometimes the first person you meet makes the strongest impression
-   **Recency bias**: when you remember the last thing you heard in an interview, conversation, or similar setting because it's the most recent
-   **Implicit bias**: unconscious bias that leads to a lack of representation in research and design processes; includes assumptions we have about certain types of people and can cause us to feel uncomfortable interviewing people whose life experiences are different from our own
-   **The sunk cost fallacy**: occurs when we continue investing in something because we've already invested time, money, or effort into it, even if it's not the best choice going forward.

These biases can affect UX designers' work and decision-making, but awareness of them can help mitigate their impact.


# KPIs Usage in UX Design

KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator, which is a measurable value that helps a company or organization determine how effectively it is achieving its objectives. In UX design, KPIs are used to measure and assess the effectiveness of a product or service.

KPIs in UX design are important because **they provide valuable insights into user behavior and satisfaction, and can help designers identify areas of improvement**. By monitoring KPIs, UX designers can make data-driven decisions that improve user experience, increase engagement, and drive business success.

Some common KPIs in UX design include:

-   **Conversion Rate**: the percentage of visitors who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or completing a form.
-   **Time on Task**: the amount of time it takes for a user to complete a specific task or set of tasks.
-   **Task Success Rate**: the percentage of users who are able to complete a task successfully.
-   **User Satisfaction**: measured through surveys or feedback, this KPI indicates how satisfied users are with the product or service.
-   **Engagement**: measured through metrics such as session duration and bounce rate, this KPI indicates how engaged users are with the product or service.

Overall, KPIs are important in UX design because they provide objective data that can help designers make informed decisions and improve user experience.
