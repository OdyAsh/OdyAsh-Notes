# What is dogfooding

Dogfooding is the practice of using one’s own products and services.

> It means using your products and services in a real-world environment for the same purpose and in the same way your end users would do.

Thus, the goal of dogfooding is not just testing of the app. It is to put yourself in the user’s shoes and see things from their perspective.

# Origin of the Term

One possible origin for the term is the 1970s television advertisements for Alpo dog food, in which the actor endorsed the product by claiming he fed Alpo to his own dogs.
