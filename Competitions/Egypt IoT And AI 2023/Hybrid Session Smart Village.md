# SDG
SDG: Sustainable Development Goals: if your GP serves one of these goals, then it will give your GP more credibility

# Invention vs Innovation
Invention example: laser
innovation example: Uber

# Telecommunications Origin
* 1844: Morse code
* 1900: Radio Communication; falls under both invention and innovation
* 1973: Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone (by Motorola) (but it was previously used as teleport communication devices used in world war 2)
# IoT
* Kevin Ashton was one of the pioneers of IoT
	* He wanted to know what's inside the coca cola vending machine (in 1982, Carnegie Mellon University ARPNET)
* from vending machine --> IoT toaster --> LG connected refrigerator --> ITU (first actual IoT device) for UN policies 
# Data Sources
Humans are the most important sourcce of data in terms of:
* data --> inventor of mobile
* needs --> coffee
* knowledge --> expertise
* process --> auto or manual (for coffee)
* logic --> order

For example, data and needs are used by facebook; from the 36 billion that FB got in 2017, 98% of that revenue was from Ads

data source in systems: samsung production line; based on user surveys, we see how many  phones to produce

Most important attributes of data: has value and business value

# IoT Hierarchy
device --> gateway --> SW --> User
Gateway (i.e., network devices) is a protocol converter

# Agriculture Iot
* UAV farming: drones are responsible for farming

# Maintenance
* shut down maintenance --> the whole system has to be shut down for maintenance
* predictive maintenance --> maintain specific parts of the system without shutting it down

# Global vs Regional Market
You have to analyze your project and see whether it fits in a global or regional market

CAGR --> ... Annual Growth Rate

# Home Exercise
IoT use case: 
* use case description
* why it will be useful?
* how will it work?

# Question Reflections
* What's your favourite animal
