God created Adam and his wife, Hawa (Eve), and placed them in the Garden of Eden. They were allowed to eat from any tree in the garden except for one, but Satan convinced them to disobey God and eat from the forbidden tree. As a result, they were banished from the garden and sent to live on Earth. Adam repented for his mistake and was forgiven by God. The story emphasizes the importance of following God's commands and seeking forgiveness for one's mistakes.

# **Important lessons we learn from Adam’s story**
[source](https://quranforkids.com/story-of-prophet-adam-as)

The **difference between Adam and Satan’s attitude was their response to their sin**. Satan’s arrogance festered, and he only grew in disobedience to Allah, opting to dedicate his existence to evil. Conversely, Adam chose to repent humbly, an act beloved to Allah. This is a great lesson for all believers. Whenever we commit a sin, our immediate response should be to repent and implore Allah to pardon us.

We must also **pay attention to Satan’s cunning methods of leading people astray**. He is a stealthy operator, who uses subtle methods to draw people towards immorality. We must not regard any sin as insignificant, for minor sins can lead to major ones. Moreover, **one may accumulate a large number of minor sins due to taking them lightly, which can eventually add up to rival a major sin**. For these reasons, we must always be wary and never consider ourselves immune to the wicked Satan’s schemes.
