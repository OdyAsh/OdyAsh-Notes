وَٱلنَّجْمِ إِذَا هَوَىٰ ﴿١﴾ مَا ضَلَّ صَاحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَىٰ

أقسم بالنجوم على صحة ما جاء به الرسول ﷺ من الوحي الإلهي؛ لأن في ذلك مناسبة عجيبة؛ فإن الله تعالى جعل النجوم زينة للسماء، فكذلك الوحي وآثاره زينة للأرض، فلولا العلم الموروث عن الأنبياء لكان الناس في ظلمة أشد من الليل البهيم. [السعدي:818.](https://altadabbur.com/source?query=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A)  

السؤال: ما المناسبة بين النجوم ونبوة النبي ﷺ؟
