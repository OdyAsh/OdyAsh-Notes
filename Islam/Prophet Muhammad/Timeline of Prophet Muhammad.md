* [[Before Muhammad.excalidraw#^tp3f7IBX|Shaiba ibn Hashim (known as Abd al-Muttalib)]] was the grandfather of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
* He had 10 sons including Abdullah, the father of Prophet Muhammad 
* He was Hashim's son, and [Abd Manaf ibn Qusai's](https://www.wikiwand.com/simple/Abd_Manaf_ibn_Qusai](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abd_Manaf_ibn_Qusai) grandson who was the leader of parts of Mecca and Abd Manaf was the son of  [Qusai](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Qusayy_ibn_Kilab) who was the leader of all of Mecca 
* Hashim called his son "Shaiba" because it refers to the white hair (i.e., شيب) that Abd al-Muttalib possessed when he was born
* When Hashim passed away, his brothers (one of them was called Muttalib) were looking for Shaiba to come live with them and help them. So when Shaiba agreed to go with his uncle al-Muttalib on the back of his horse, people thought that Shaiba was al-Muttalib's slave (i.e., عبد), so they called Shaiba "Abd al-Muttalib"
