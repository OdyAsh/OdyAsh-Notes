# Denotation

the literal or primary meaning of a word, in contrast to the feelings or ideas that the word suggests. 

Example: "beyond their immediate denotation, the words have a [connotative](#Connotations) power"

Alternative meaning: the action of indicating or referring to something by means of a word, symbol, etc.

# Connotations

In linguistics and literary theory, a 'connotation' is a 'secondary '(often emotional) meaning (or a range of associations) evoked by a word beyond its explicit [denotation](#Denotation) or dictionary meaning.

Such meanings may be implied by the writer or speaker and/or inferred by the reader or listener.

Examples ([source](https://helpfulprofessor.com/positive-neutral-negative-connotation-examples/)):

- **Positive connotation:** The word “home” might have positive connotations of safety and comfort
- **Neutral connotation:** The word “house” might have a neutral connotation. It’s an objective way of describing where you live.
- **Negative connotation:** The word “prison” might have negative connotations of confinement and punishment. So, a teenager colloquially saying “My house is a prison” to refer to their house is giving their house a negative connotation.
