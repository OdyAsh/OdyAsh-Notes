# Why Data Engineering?

 #five-vs-of-big-data

Because of the 5 Vs of big data ([s2](https://informationcatalyst.com/vision-experience/big-data-value/)):

Also regarding volume and velocity:
* If the data to be processed is bigger than the device's RAM, then it can't be processed, or has to be processed in chunks, which costs time.
* So, if we distribute this data across clusters (i.e., distributed computing, parallelization, etc.), then each device (i.e., node) can process some of that data in its RAM in a quicker fashion ([s1, 1:30](https://youtu.be/AGgyf9bO_8M?list=PLlUZLZydkS7_8WnK8fMENmJFSfPwxw9Fi&t=88)).
