# MLOps vs DevOps

MLOps is an extension of DevOps. Not a fork. ([s1](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-is-extension-of-devops#:~:text=here%20it%20is%3A-,MLOps%20is%20an%20extension%20of%20DevOps.%20Not%20a%20fork,-%3A%0A%E2%80%93%20The%20MLOps)):

# BUE `_VOIS` Session in 2023 

Overview of MLOps flow:
* Model saving & loading
* API
* Docker
* Cloud deployment

## Model Saving and Loading

Why save models:
* Save re-training time
* create multiple versions of the model
* Use model in different environments
* Use models created by others

Types of saving files:
* PMML (allows saving/loading models to/from other programming languages)
* JSON
* Joblib
* Pickle



## API Basics

Analogy: application <-> API <-> backend

* Stands for application programming interface
* It is an interface that allow applications or even components of the same application to communicate and interact with each other
* Communication is done using a set of definitions and protocols (ex: HTTP)
* Could be free or not
* Popular examples: ChatGPT, Google API, Facebook API, etc.
* Can be accessed via:
	* Browser
	* Programming language
	* Command line in terminal (curl)
	* API platform (e.g., postman)
		* Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs.
		* Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs.
		* Can be used for:
			* API design
			* API documentation
			* **API testing**
			* Mock servers
			* Monitors
			* API detection (in your browser)
		* Generally, the ML team communicates with the front-end team about the structure of the passed JSON to/from the API.
* Types of endpoints (APIs):
	* SOAP APIs
	* RPC APIs
	* Websocket APIs
	* REST APIs
		* Stands for REpresentational State Transfer
		* Most popular/flexible APIs found on the web today
		* ML usually uses this REST API
		* REST API flow: 
		* client sends a **request** (request line, header, body, etc.) to the server.
		* server sends **response** (status line, headers, body, etc.) back to client 
			* "status line" is the "status code" that the server responds with. For example, "400" and "200" corresponds to error and success in the response respectively.


## Python in MLOps

Popular frameworks in Python:
* Flask
* FastAPI
	* Relatively simple
* Django
	* More complex
* Streamlit

### Flask

* Easily implements web applications
* Unlike Django, it is very Pythonic
* Handles low-level details
* Flexible
* Considered a micro-framework


## Docker

Explained in the [Docker Basics](../Docker/Docker%20Basics.md) file.

## Cloud Deployment

### Cloud vs On-Premise

Cloud - on-remise:
* Pricing: monthly subscription - one-time investment
* Data access: access only via CFM API/connectors - complete access
* Storage: 5GB (extra 2.5GB for every 20 licenses) - limited to available server storage
* Maintenance costs: None - equal to server maintenance cost
* Deployment: fast and simple - complicated, as it requires physical installations
* Up time: 99% uptime but rely on internet connectivity - do not rely on internet to access CRM

Steps to deploy dockerized flas app on AWS using ECS and ECR:
* Create an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository to store the image.
	* ECR is like Docker Hub; it is where we push the Docker image.
* Push the Flask application image to ECR repository.
* Create an ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster.
	* ECS is what we run the docker container on.
* Set up an EC2 instance.
* Deploy and then run the app.

## MLOps and DevOps

DevOps:
* Responsible for automating deployment/testing/maintenance efforts, so that programmers can focus on the project's functionalities/code.
	* Example, when a new feature is developed, the process of deploying/testing this feature is automated; this automation is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).

MLOps:
* We need MLOps to:
	* work with largescale projects
	* track ML experiments and data history
	* reduce time of delivery
	* reduce human errors
	* reproduce ML experiments
	* Documentation
* Tools include:
	* Git
	* docker
	* Apache Airflow
		* Can schedule based on DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
	* MLFlow
		* Tracks ML experiments
	* DVC
		* Similar to git, but for data.
	* Terraform
		* Automates the cloud-related steps by writing configuration file (.yaml file) that automates these cloud steps (e.g., AWS steps of creating EC2 instance, etc.)
	* Jenkins

Interesting info:
* When a new feature/model gets deployed, it runs on certain devices, so that if a bug is found, the feature can be roll-backed easily.

## Interview Tips

* Regarding the CV, make sure to emphasize keywords regarding the job description
	* For example, sometimes HR only chooses CVs that contained "AWS" and "time-series".
* Often, you'll get asked about tools more than ML theory (i.e., model types, etc.)
* The most required skills over all interview types/disciplines: **soft skills**
* Regarding technical skills:
	* If 2 people have great soft skills, the person who has knowledge about more tools that are required for the job position will probably be chosen.
* Interviews start with basic questions (e.g., python related questions), then drill down to more detailed topics (e.g., what is Jenkins? etc.)
