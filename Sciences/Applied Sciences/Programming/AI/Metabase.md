# Display Legend in Area Chart

One of the ways to create a stacked area chart, is to first create a new question, then put any `summarize by`, `group by` fields, then click `visualize`, then in the metabase page you're directed to, click here:

Then:

Adding the category column (e.g., `Target Week`) in step 2, then ordering this column to be at the bottom of the grouped by items as shown in step 4, will cause metabase to display this column as legend, and so the areas of each legend item will be stacked on top of each other. To disable this stacking, click here:
