# Using AI to Summarize The Questions

Now, the questions as of #2024-01-31  were summarized by [Microsoft's copilot](https://youtu.be/5rEZGSFgZVY?t=38) and altered then partially answered by me to be the following:

1. **Choosing a Specialization** (answered in [Choosing your Specialization](#Choosing%20your%20Specialization) section)
    - What is the mentality needed to determine which specialization to pick?
    - If interested in two majors, how to choose between them?
    - Which specialization is the most comprehensive and could help land a job in most tech fields?
	    - Note that the "comprehensive" part of the question will be answered in the [Knowledge Overlaps and Requirements Per Specialization](#Knowledge%20Overlaps%20and%20Requirements%20Per%20Specialization) section, but for the "job" part of the question:
			- In Egypt, remotely or on-site: SE.
			- Outside of Egypt:
				- Remotely: SE.
				- On-site: SE, but specific AI/IS data-related jobs are also prevalent, especially [Data Engineering](Data%20Engineering/Data%20Engineering.md).
    - Which specialization is better if you want to work in embedded systems or robotics?
    	- In the BUE, I believe they're all not beneficial for embedded systems (as we've already taken that content before specializing). Moreover, for robotics, there's a subject in AI called "AI Planning for Robot Systems". However, ***until 2022***, it delved into the history and high-level knowledge about the origin of robotics, instead of practical tools/knowledge on how to implement systems for robotics. Check the headers of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/kpkne5/how_to_get_started_in_robotics_education_career/#:~:text=Programming%3A%20If%20you%20want%20to,bring%20while%20developing%20robotics%20software.) reddit answer to see what you might need to learn for embedded/robotics field.
1. **AI vs SE vs CS vs IS**
    - What is the difference between SE, CS, and IS if looking for a job in these fields (web front and/or back, mobile, cloud)?
        - First of all, let's agree that if you want to work in one of the fields mentioned above, then you'll major in SE.
        - SE:
            - If the field's company/project is relatively small, then you'll almost develop the end-to-end (E2E) system. 
            - For example, in web development jobs, you'll work on designing the UI/UX of the website based on the business logic, creating the database's tables, filling in the data, coding the back-end logic, coding the front-end logic, hosting and maintaining the website.
        - IS: 
            - You'll mostly work on data related logic.
            - Continuing the web dev. example: you'll probably be responsible for mapping the business logic into a relational schema, and then mapping this schema to actual tables. Similar logic applies for [NoSQL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/164dOhkDoYv065nVJdvYLw9e6tkJqb_487kGBhHXQ0W4/edit#heading=h.hbccxpdpecog) DBs.
        - CS: Regarding BUE modules, you can choose optional modules that will help in these fields (e.g., cloud computing), but other than that, you'll just study web-dev required knowledge.
    - Can I study both web dev and mobile dev and/or any other field with uni. and be able to grasp the content?
        - In the BUE, and as of 2023, I don't think there's a module which teaches mobile dev. However, you might be able to juggle between studying SE and mobile dev due to [overlapping knowledge required for mobile and web dev](https://medium.com/@godlinjosheelasugki/are-you-a-mobile-app-developer-considering-a-move-to-web-development-df16e232f58b#:~:text=The%20Overlapping%20Skills&text=These%20include%3A,across%20mobile%20and%20web%20development.).
        - By the same logic, if you're in any other major, I think it will be more difficult, since you'll find a few overlapping knowledge.
2. **AI Specialization** (answered in [AI Specialization Questions](#AI%20Specialization%20Questions) section)
    - Is the education from uni. enough for AI or do I need extra courses?
    - What are the important courses for AI?
    - Is 3D Gaming an optional in AI or removed?
    - In the AI optional modules, is the module called humanoid robots interesting and what exactly do we do in it?
    - What math should I know before going through AI?
    - Can I balance SE and AI courses?
3. **SE Specialization** (answered [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit?usp=drive_link) based on [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVycV2o_Oe1myUim-9tfKRkbyFMVRP-tFzoSYqkdzuOCGH3w/viewform?usp=sf_link) Google form)
    - If my Java skills are not the best, will I face any difficulties in SE?
	    - Answered by various graduates [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=U:U).
    - How heavy is coding in SE?
        - Compared to other specializations? The heaviest.
    - What are the important courses for SE?
	    - Various graduates' answers (based on  [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVycV2o_Oe1myUim-9tfKRkbyFMVRP-tFzoSYqkdzuOCGH3w/viewform?usp=sf_link) Google form) is visualized below:
	      
	      ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240202204833.png)
1. **Job Market** (answered in the [Job Market Questions](#Job%20Market%20Questions) section)
    - Will I find a good job? If yes, what’s the minimum salary?
    - Which specialization realistically gets most opportunities to travel outside Egypt?
    - What is the most optimal and easiest specialization to help land a remote job?
    - Are the jobs in AI as interesting as the topics?
    - Are there good and many jobs for the AI department in the Egyptian market?
    - Can graduates find jobs easily?
    - What jobs are there for AI graduates in the Egyptian market?
    - What jobs are there for SE graduates in the Egyptian market?
    - Does choosing a specific major make you lose out on many job opportunities?
    - For a specific sector like AI security, which major would be better?
    - Is there a huge gap between college modules and the work field (are the skills we learn in uni enough to land a job)?
    - Since the job market in tech is tough right now and companies are not hiring fresh grads like they used to in 2020-2022, how many jobs exist right now for SE and AI?
    - How much experience is needed to land a job in development and SE specializations?
2. **Graduation Projects**
    - How are graduation projects in SE, CS, IS, and AI like? Are they all group projects and how do they look like?
	    - In the BUE, we're one of the few faculties where the GP is individual, not group.
	    - You might find [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXQQn30uBJziQM9iX9atL-War-X2DW67/view?usp=sharing) sample ideas document to be useful. Of course, you can choose your own GP idea, or improve a GP done by someone else, like a [memes project](https://github.com/OdyAsh/graduation_project?tab=readme-ov-file#graduation-project) :\].
3. **Prerequisites**
    - What are the prerequisites for SE, AI, CS, and IS specializations so we don’t go in blind?
	    - Answered by various graduates [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=X:X).
4. **Cross-specialization Modules**
    - If I want to take some AI modules if I am in SE, can I do that?
	    - Check the side notes of the [BUE Modules Per Specialization](#BUE%20Modules%20Per%20Specialization) section.
	    - However, as I said before, I personally don't recommend this.
	    - If you are great at math however, then you'll possibly be able to balance the modules, but I still wouldn't recommend doing this.
5. **Masters Programs**
    - What are the available masters programs in AI field and which are the highest in demand to land a job?
	    - Check [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/msc-programs/), [Nile university](https://itcs.nu.edu.eg/program/artificial-intelligence), and [this](https://edurank.org/cs/ai/eg/#:~:text=Below%20is%20a,to%20final%20scores.) list of Egypt universities.
	    - As of 2023, the BUE doesn't have an AI masters. However, the ICS masters that it has is flexible. In other words, you get to choose the topic of your project, and what's important in any masters is the master thesis and project that you do at the end. 
6. **Personal Experience**
    - What made you pick AI? What was your goal and how did you reverse engineer it to reach it?
	    - Will be answered in the video ISA :\].



# Choosing your Specialization

## BUE Modules Per Specialization

tool used: [here](https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/).

Sources (from least outdated to most outdated): 
* search for ICS Excel file shared by one of the TAs [here](https://livebueedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ashraf196280_bue_edu_eg/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?view=3), and check for the `Modules Teams` sheet:
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240202145927.png)
* [This](https://learn1.bue.edu.eg/course/index.php?categoryid=4) E-Learning page.

The list of modules of each specialization can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wExON8zV3sbf1hoipts_LsznLfMOWYJM9EPi7qAipwU/edit#heading=h.843zzs6wkts).

IMPORTANT: The intersection between the specializations' modules can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SzKZXzVGHpCSpZO9bACl-XES3CoZFkIxDRLIOXJk5rY/edit?usp=drive_link) .

Side note 1: some modules are optional to some specializations, and mandatory to others. For example, Computer Security is mandatory for AI (and CN?), but optional for SE (and CS?)

Side note 2: 
* In Y3S1, you usually have 3 core modules, 2 optional modules, and GP (total: 6 modules). 
* In Y3S2, 2 core module, 2 optional modules, and GP (total: 5 modules). 
	* Side note: technically, the GP has the weight of 2 modules in this semester.
	* So across Y3, the GP constitutes the weight of 3 entire modules; 1 for the dissertation paper, and 2 for the implementation.
* I think you can apply for more than 2 optional modules for CS though, since it has very few core modules, but their total modules in semester 1 and 2 are also 6 and 5.

Side note 3:
* The optional modules are kind of flexible per major. For example, in the list below, you'll see that only AI and CS can take ANN module. However, I've seen SE students ask exception from the ANN module leader to take it as an optional module. 
* However, I strongly don't advise this (especially for ANN module).

Side note 4:
* You can see how students ranked some of these modules (especially SE ones) [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit?usp=drive_link) based on [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVycV2o_Oe1myUim-9tfKRkbyFMVRP-tFzoSYqkdzuOCGH3w/viewform?usp=sf_link) Google form.
	* Side note 1: just skip to the columns to the right, since the columns on the left aren't really readable.

## Mentality about Specialization Aspects

This section answers these questions:

- What is the mentality needed to determine which specialization to pick?
- If interested in two majors, how to choose between them?

Side note: Some of my thoughts are adapted from [here](https://getnotable.ai/n/RIo6On7oEB) (where I knew the [getnotable.ai](https://getnotable.ai/home) website from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16db0zp/comment/kgaohzo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), and these notes were summarized from [this](https://dev.to/marcbeaujean/should-new-developers-specialize-j46) dev.to post.

Common aspects to consider for each specialization, from most important to least important (in my opinion):

* Ethical and religious implications.
* Job market status.
	* Having a broad skillset can keep you open to more opportunities.
	* How niche is your specialization? (i.e., few local experts in this specialization, since it's hard to be acquired.)
	* Does this specialization have a high market demand?
* Worldly reasons.
	* Income (💰🫰), pleasing others, status/fame/recognition, respect, etc.
* Passion (over-rated).
	* We are not passionate about a job because of its detailed steps and mechanisms.
	* We are passionate about a job because of how it shapes us and solidifies our values.
* Capabilities.
	* How much can you efficiently apply the "[Constructivism](https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/develop/theory/constructivism.html)" learning theory? Can you properly incorporate newly gained information with past knowledge? 
	* Do you learn better from [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp9GhZXYWKAx7ynTHL4RC2f_g6LIlknTH) or [articles](https://medium.com/)/[papers](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/173pvsv/where_do_you_get_your_ai_news/)/[blogs](https://daily.dev/)?
		* IMPORTANT: Read [this](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf) paper on how to read papers. Really useful read :\].
		* Check the citations .gif in [general tips folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M_6wZ6GM7xakzCwVVflgqYijt6q01Y1a?usp=drive_link) to see how to easily add citations to word.
	* Are you good at getting [very specific info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmnimxjaarM) from [barely known resources](https://www.youtube.com/@noone988-Ahmed-Fathi/playlists)?
* Job type.
	* IT jobs are [generally](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8sfo6e/comment/e0z844w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) CRUD jobs or kind-of-non-[CRUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4k7n9y/what_is_a_crud_job/) jobs. Do you tolerate both? Or do you have a preference?


## Knowledge Overlaps and Requirements Per Specialization

This sections answers:
- Which specialization is the most comprehensive and could help land a job in most tech fields?
	- I'm only answering the "comprehensive" part here. The "job" part is in the [Using AI to Summarize The Questions](#Using%20AI%20to%20Summarize%20The%20Questions) section.

This section is related to the `capabilities` and `job market` bullet points in [Mentality about Specialization Aspects](#Mentality%20about%20Specialization%20Aspects) section.

Quick English 101 recap:

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240131104055.png)

Now, regarding ICS specializations , I'll ***personally*** rank comprehensive sps from most comprehensive to least comprehensive by 2 aspects:

* How much they give you knowledge ***used by other specializations*** (implicitly or explicitly) (high to low):
	* CS (implicitly)
		* Can be thought an "origin of life" documentary for computing devices, so theoretically speaking, this knowledge is implicitly used in all other IT fields. Example: the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation#:~:text=In%20theoretical%20computer,computers%3F%22.%5B1%5D) module.
		* Discusses problems that are implicitly prevalent in all other IT fields like limitations of computers, time complexity, etc.
	* IS
		* 99% of IT jobs include working with data and managing data systems, so no matter your specialization/job, you'll most likely need a certain level of IS info (e.g., SQL, index types, etc.).
	* SE
		* Most IT jobs will require some form of software developed, so even if a company's required functionality is related to AI, security monitoring, etc., it will require a software program to host/display this functionality. A very small example of this is the web UI of [this](https://paragraph-miner.streamlit.app/) AI application, noting that this website is so small to the point that it doesn't require an SE graduate to do it 😅. Nevertheless, it is an example of how SE-related knowledge can be used in other fields.
	* CN
		* Job examples include setting up the network infrastructure of a company to applying security protocols to secure the company's assets.
		* However, knowledge about basic principles of networking is a must, as different fields (AI/SE/...) require understanding of IP addresses, ports, domain names, firewall limitations, etc.
			* Not sure if detailed info about these topics are mentioned in depth in the BUE's CN specialization or not though. 
			* Either way, I personally think this info is enough to be obtained online, unless you're actually interested in network infrastructure/security, etc.
	* AI
		* Large overlap with IS based on the exact job role; Examples:
			* Data Engineering job.
			* Any other AI job, but only in the data processing section (in case you're using SQL, etc.).
		* Some AI jobs require understanding [cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-6cX0HRXh5nmyjDCAjxOyQtKGQ0SvME?usp=drive_link) related logic, which is very prevalent in SE. Moreover, I believe [this](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-is-extension-of-devops#:~:text=Data%20scientist%20vs,heavy%20backend%20engineers.) part of the  article greatly explains the large knowledge overlap between specific AI and SE jobs, especially in [DevOps](../DevOps/DevOps.md)/[MLOps](Data%20Engineering/MLOps.md) related jobs.
		* I think the Math required for AI overlaps a little with that of CS, but I'm not sure of this.
		* Rarely overlaps with CN.
			* even the math of CN (security) requires info about number theory more than calculus, etc.
		* In general, some required knowledge for AI, specifically the Math, will probably not be needed anywhere else.

* How much they ***require knowledge*** to "mostly" grasp and understand their core concepts (high to low):
	* AI
		* How to process data (like in IS, and beyond that).
		* Domain knowledge about the business (to choose the right AI model) and about the topic of the data (e.g., biology if you're dealing with data in the medical field, etc.).
		* Math. Mainly, Linear Algebra and Calculus, but this is the least thing you need to understand out of the three. 
			* Unless you're planning be an academic researcher, work in R&D, or work in specific AI jobs that require developing AI models, which are relatively rare in Egypt.
	* CS
		* **Math**.
	* CN
		* Math. Mainly, number theory. I don't know what else to be honest.
		* If you're planning on walking the security path (specifically, hacking), then I guess you need to communicate in a sub-alien language which no one else understands except other security practitioners. [Example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akenofu_url-fuzzer-401403-bypass-activity-7151069471309258753-PdYN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
			* JK though, huge respect to these guys (don't hack me plz).
	* SE
		* Coding. I know all fields require coding, but I feel like SE really requires that you love coding, since it's literally all about how to engineer a coding solution for your software program/service/website.
		* Testing. Again, all fields require this, but in SE specifically, you'll most likely need to at least [unit test](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/types-of-software-testing/) your code. 
	* IS
		* Intuitive understanding of how to deal with data. Examples:
			* Sorted data is easier for lookups but harder for insertion/deletions.
			* if two people are accessing the same data, then there could be write conflicts/deadlocks.
			* If data processing is independent for each data point, then data can easily be processed parallelly across multiple devices.


Note about the "required knowledge" bullet point: this doesn't necessarily mean AI is the hardest and IS is the easiest, but it means, in my opinion, that AI is the most field that will simply require more time to mostly grasp, as you'll need to heavily apply the "[Constructivism](https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/develop/theory/constructivism.html)" learning theory previously talked about in the [Mentality about Specialization Aspects](#Mentality%20about%20Specialization%20Aspects) section. 

# AI Specialization Questions

- Is the education from uni. enough for AI or do I need extra courses?
	- No . Education . From . Any . University . is . Enough.
	- Any Module . In The BUE . Is An Introductory Module.
	- Now, there's no right answer here, but I'll provide what I would've **personally** done if I could go back in time: 
		- Heavily focus on the BUE's Data Science project. It will teach you the fundamental data pipeline you'll use in most AI projects. Especially, the storytelling part.
		- In the summer before the senior year, get some idea on the **theoretical (not practical/coding)** aspects of ML, ANN, DL, and NLP. I guess the sources I provided in [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kVOV-kCxXU8OAdMmrmWVqWCATNDtNjxn?usp=drive_link) should be sufficient. 
		- Understand how to read Math equations. The Math isn't as essential as you think; there are a lot of jobs that treat AI models as black boxes without understanding the math. However, at least understand the basics which you were previously taught in school. Check the resources mentioned in my [Math revision note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmbwWFL447FJ_aQeyjASLhWH5b-h_FRywGVQKSsOK_E/edit?usp=drive_link) as a starting point.
		- If you have time, quickly glance over DevOps and MLOps; just have an idea that they exist. [DevOps](../DevOps/DevOps.md), [CI-CD](../DevOps/CI-CD.md), and [MLOps](Data%20Engineering/MLOps.md) notes should be a good starting point.
	- Finally, focus on [other skills](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/10-unconventional-lessons-from-10-years-working-as-a-software-engineer-873d5d4ae4a2) obtained through time. Side note: you can get the [smart TOC](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-toc/lifgeihcfpkmmlfjbailfpfhbahhibba) chrome extension to quickly see the headers in an article.
	- Another graduate's opinion: In AI especially, it’s not only about taking courses, you need to constantly to keep reading either articles, research papers, and books. Especially since this specific field is growing exponentially.


- What are the important courses for AI?
	- Answered vaguely in the previous question. 
	- When studying, you have two extremely different options:
		- Religiously follow one bootcamp/course/diploma/university, and rarely deviate from it. 
		- Generally understand what you need to learn (via the AI modules in my BUE notes, a [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist), working on a project, etc.), and whenever you get stuck on something you don't understand, watch different articles/videos/courses on the topic, then move on.
	- Personal advice: Follow 70% of option 2 and 30% of option 1. Don't bind yourself to content/lecturer/course you don't like just to finish it. This could make you abandon the path due to frustrations/boredom. Solution: switch to other related topics from different resources, then return to the path. 
	- Example: the [Vector](../../../Formal%20Sciences/Mathematics/Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Vector.md) note is from resources different than the [math course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) I was initially taking. 


- Is 3D Gaming an optional in AI or removed?
	- As of 2023, in the BUE, it is still an optional module, but I personally don't recommend taking it due to the importance of other optional modules (ANN/cloud/DB) in relation to AI, unless you really love **developing** games :\] 🔥.


- In the AI optional modules, is the module called humanoid robots interesting and what exactly do we do in it?
	- As of 2023, in the BUE, it is not an optional module. The nearest module to this is called "AI Planning for Robot Systems" (APRS). It is mandatory for AI only. Past (possibly outdated) notes can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning). As of 2023, it was good for an AI graduate to know, but rarely useful in the job market. You will literally study how robots used to plan the actions that they were about to do.
	- 2024 update: apparently, APRS also teaches you basics about reinforcement learning, [which is sometimes a factor in designing robot systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGULBBAo5lA).


- What math should I know before going through AI?
	- First of all, DO NOT get intimidated by the Math you see in the referenced resources below. I was intimidated at first, but I swear, you just need to find [the right people](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/zmo58p/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_math_explainer/) who will teach Math in an intuitive way, [and you'll actually like it](https://youtu.be/PXwStduNw14?t=371). You got this :\] ✊.
	- Linear Algebra, Calculus for ANN/ML/DL/NLP modules. Strong advice: Understand the intuition, not how to solve problems. Check 3B1B's [Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) and [Calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus) courses. I still come back to them to this day. If you literally understand 60% and try to solve the small multiple-choices questions found on the courses, you'll be golden 👍. Pro-tip: While going through the videos, pay extra attention to topics mentioned [here](https://github.com/afshinea/stanford-cs-229-machine-learning/blob/master/en/refresher-algebra-calculus.pdf) (obtained from [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/02/complete-collection-data-science-cheat-sheets-part-1.html#:~:text=Image%20by%20stories-,Probability,SciPy%3A%20Linear%20Algebra%20in%20Python,-Data%20Analytics)).
	- Statistics for Data Science module, and Probability for all AI modules. Oddly enough, the best way I've learned these concepts was through Medium and TowardsDataScience articles, hopefully these websites will [help](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ceZb8BjHqExkqS7d17C5mREuf4ByCahYAltefqEQjns/edit?usp=sharing) ;\). So I guess I'll suggest checking these great [probabilities](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cme-106/cheatsheet-probability) and [statistics](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cme-106/cheatsheet-statistics) cheat sheets (found from [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/02/complete-collection-data-science-cheat-sheets-part-1.html#:~:text=Image%20by%20stories-,Probability,SciPy%3A%20Linear%20Algebra%20in%20Python,-Data%20Analytics)), and googling each topic whenever you're free... or take a course.
	- Another advice from another graduate: Generally, you will find a lot of books for Mathematics for ML and books for Mathematics for Data science.
		- I agree with this opinion if you plan to continue on the academic path (research, possibly R&D). 
		- Don't get discouraged by "a lot of books" phrasing; you obviously won't read them in their entirety; remember the second learning method that I talked about in the answer of "What are the important courses for AI?" question.


- Can I balance SE and AI courses?
	- Difficult. You can balance SE and IS maybe, but it is difficult to balance SE and AI due to the few [overlapping](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2022/06/09928183/1HJux2cbygM#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20skills,systems%2C%20or%20engineering%20knowledge.) [hard-skills](https://youtu.be/0FFLFcB9xfQ?t=15) they require. For example, basic code design like OOP (even though it's [rarely used](https://medium.com/mlops-community/jupyter-notebooks-in-production-4e0d38803251#:~:text=I%20find%20them,sounds%20like%20nonsense) in some AI jobs due to the prevalence of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDxcR1V7Qg)), and [basic code refactoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHEFXKTiJ00).
	- Don't let that discourage you, you can technically balance between the two, but you'll most likely possess [a T-shaped skillset, not a pi-shaped skillset](https://www.bridgeinteractive.co.uk/insights/why-startups-should-seek-out-the-t-shaped-skill-set-for-their-next-hire#:~:text=I%2Dshaped%20%E2%80%93%20These,particularly%20in%20leadership.).
	- Another opinion by another graduate: Yeah, you can manage to study any SE/web development on the side.

# Job Market Questions

- Will I find a good job? If yes, what’s the minimum salary?
	- "good" can be defined in so many ways. High salary? Healthy work environment? A lot of work-from-home days? High growth rate of soft/hard skills?
	- The "minimum" salary is relative, and depends on the job environment you're at. For example, I personally like to classify Egypt's IT job market for a fresh graduate into 5 environment levels:
		- Internship environment: same environment as "local/IT environment" mentioned below, but you work mainly to learn, not to earn :\].
		- Academic environment; Teaching Assistant (TA) job, professor/instructor, researcher. etc.
		- Local environment: Those are the IT companies that you find near Cairo's busy streets, etc. 
		- IT environment: Smart village in El Sheikh Zayed, etc.
		- Freelancing environment.
	- So sometimes, you'll see the senior level positions of a local environment get similar salaries to entry-level positions of an IT environment. HOWEVER, that senior could be working at a new project for a semi-startup company, and so they're learning much more than a possibly mundane job of a corporate company. That's why the definition of a "good" job really matters.
	- Of course, this is all subjective based on what I've seen happen to my friends.
	- But to answer the question, a very minimum salary is 3k EGP for intern jobs, 5k for academic/teaching jobs, 7k for local jobs. 15k for corporate jobs. Again, this is based on what I've seen. (source: Ash and his friends :\])


- Which specialization realistically gets most opportunities to travel outside Egypt? lose out on many job opportunities
	- As far as I know, none. You travel outside by making connections. 
	- Keep in touch with that smart dude who's been freelancing/studying/remotely-working while you're barely surviving uni. 
	- To BUE students, you are in the **B**UE, you get to see a lot of non-Egyptians here. Know them. Ask them questions while showing respects. After time, they will remember you when you come by again.
	- Go to IT job fairs like Engineerex. I know someone who got to work in the same company as me, by attending a job fare, filling out forms, and engaging with the staff there. You may land a job here, and the connections you make facilitate your travel.
	- Build up an online brand. That can be done by taking freelancing jobs, showcasing your work on LinkedIn, or [blogging](https://dev.to/).
		- I've been interviewed for a UK job because of LinkedIn.
	- Finally, and most importantly, I personally think travelling outside is over-rated. If you get relatively good money or work remotely from Egypt, stay. That's just personal advice. It's good to learn about other cultures, but living there means that, one by one, you slowly lose your Arabian identity. Obviously someone might ask: "and what's the problem with that?", and I don't think I can shortly respond to this question, so I'll just leave it unanswered here, but [feel free to message me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashrafharess/) if you want to hear my opinion, I love discussions like these :\].



- What is the most optimal and easiest specialization to help land a remote job?
	- Software Engineering. Specifically, web development.
	- However, AI is slowly [taking over](https://youtu.be/pPvoccZKjF8?t=55) this area.
	- But [generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJMgDqHyXbo), mobile/web/ui/ux development and testing jobs, and some of these are in SE.


- Are the jobs in AI as interesting as the topics?
	- That depends on your definition of "interesting".
	- Regarding data science, yes. Data analytics/science jobs are 80% similar to the data science module.
	- Regarding ANN, rarely. ANN teaches us the historical models which are foundation for DL/NLP.
	- Regarding ML/DL/NLP, yes to some degree; most of the "interesting" stuff will be shrouded with [CI-CD](../DevOps/CI-CD.md) logic for [MLOps](Data%20Engineering/MLOps.md). However, advanced ML/DL/NLP jobs may get you working on low-level model details, which could be interesting/challenging, but some of these jobs require a masters degree.
	- In my opinion, the most interesting/challenging jobs are academic/research related; [R&D jobs](https://ai-jobs.net/insights/rd-explained/#:~:text=R%26D%2C%20in%20the%20context%20of,problems%20and%20improve%20existing%20systems.), researcher jobs, etc.



- Are there good and many jobs for the AI department in the Egyptian market?
	- If you have connections/online presence, yes.
	- Compared to SE jobs, fewer.
	- Personally, I've seen a lot more data analytics/science jobs than ML/DL/NLP engineer jobs.



- What jobs are there for AI graduates in the Egyptian market?
	- Examples: Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, DL Engineer, NLP Engineer, MLOps engineer, etc.
	- Descriptions can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-demanded-job-roles-in-artificial-intelligence/).



- For a specific sector like AI security, which major would be better?
	- AI, until the new security (CSec) specialization opens in the BUE.
	- Moreover, applying security in AI usually means [finding solutions to security problems using AI tools](https://youtu.be/V6GPVN2zbS0?t=1221) (e.g., 20:00 to 21:30, where AI is used to detect abnormal activities in a company's network of devices).
	- It could also mean [using AI tools securely](https://youtu.be/PqjDPBBuqVE?t=78).
	- Both of these are not covered in AI specialization, but AI is still the most relevant specialization for these topics.


- What jobs are there for SE graduates in the Egyptian market?
	- Examples: Testing jobs, web dev. jobs, mobile dev. jobs, application dev. jobs, UI/UX jobs, [DevOps](../DevOps/DevOps.md) jobs.
	- Answers by various graduates can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=W:W).


- Can graduates find jobs easily?
	- If you have connections/online presence, yes.
	- If you ask questions and fill forms in IT job fairs, probably yes.
	- If you apply for the occasional BUE Student Hub initiatives (build your CV, etc.), then most-likely, yes. 



- Does choosing a specific major make you lose out on many job opportunities?
	- Not really, the majors' modules are introductory, so it's relatively easy to migrate from one IT domain to another.
	- Answers by various graduates can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=T:T).


- Is there a huge gap between college modules and the work field (are the skills we learn in uni. enough to land a job)?
	- In AI, the gap is not too big. You'll primarily notice that you'll probably need to understand and use [DevOps](../DevOps/DevOps.md)/[MLOps](Data%20Engineering/MLOps.md) tools (git, Docker, MLFlow, Jenkins, etc.).
	- Answers by various graduates can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=S:S).


- Since the job market in tech is tough right now and companies are not hiring fresh grads like they used to in 2020-2022, how many jobs exist right now for SE and AI?
	- Even though the rise of AI tools and increase in the number of IT fresh graduates have negatively affected the possibility of landing a job, you shouldn't worry.
	- There are fewer jobs in some IT domains, yes, but be aware that there are also new IT domains that are starting to get attention again or for the first time. For example, [prompt engineering](https://youtu.be/yu27PWzJI_Y?t=66) (new job), or [Data Engineering](Data%20Engineering/Data%20Engineering.md) (old job, but still heavily required).


- How much experience is needed to land a job in development and SE specializations?
	- Answered by various graduates [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXXjh4JpUOrgQWG4c1LfpiOvKas7fOnupnkeEGyQy6I/edit#gid=895784434&range=R:R).
