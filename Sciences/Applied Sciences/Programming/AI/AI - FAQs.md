The following [questions](https://livebueedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ashraf196280_bue_edu_eg/EYZW4Ai4aGZNkrS0gdYiAsEBPgNcs7-gevJxupUX4vQ-xQ?e=VbGmq7) are taken from an excel sheet I did a while back where I asked BUE students if they had any concerns with AI, but since there are questions related to the practical side of computer science, I added this note to [Applied Sciences](../../Applied%20Sciences.md) instead of [Formal Sciences](../../../Formal%20Sciences/Formal%20Sciences.md) :\].

Abbreviations:
* "sp" -> "Specialization".
* "uni." -> university.
* AI / SE / IS / CN / CS -> Artificial Intelligence / Software Engineering / Information Systems / Computer Networks / Computer Science.

# Using AI to Summarize The Questions

Now, the questions as of #2024-01-31  were summarized by [Microsoft's copilot](https://youtu.be/5rEZGSFgZVY?t=38) and altered by me to be the following:

1. **Choosing a Specialization**
    - What is the mentality needed to determine which specialization to pick?
    - If interested in two majors, how to choose between them?
    - Which specialization is the most comprehensive and could help land a job in most tech fields?
    - Which specialization is better if you want to work in embedded systems or robotics?
2. **AI vs SE vs CS vs IS**
    - What is the difference between SE, CS, and IS if looking for a job in these fields (web front and/or back, mobile, cloud)?
    - Can I study both web dev and mobile dev and/or any other field with uni. and be able to grasp the content?
3. **AI Specialization**
    - Is the education from uni. enough for AI or do I need extra courses?
    - What are the important courses for AI?
    - Is 3D Gaming an optional in AI or removed?
    - In the AI optional modules, is the module called humanoid robots interesting and what exactly do we do in it?
    - What math should I know before going through AI?
    - Can I balance SE and AI courses?
4. **SE Specialization**
    - If my Java skills are not the best, will I face any difficulties in SE?

# Presentation Preparation

At first, I was searching for an AI tool that will help me generate slides based on the bullet points above, so it was either [slidemaker](https://www.slidemake.com/) (which I knew from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/11qj9ba/i_created_an_aipowered_powerpoint_maker_to/?sort=new)), or [gamma.app](https://gamma.app/) (which I knew from [there's an ai for that](https://theresanaiforthat.com/presentation-slides/?ref=suggest&sort=most-saved)), or [prezo.ai](https://prezo.ai/) (also from there's an ai for that), but then I decided to choose gamma.app:

# Choosing your Specialization

## Mentality about Specialization Aspects

This section answers these questions:

- What is the mentality needed to determine which specialization to pick?
- If interested in two majors, how to choose between them?

Some of my thoughts are adapted from [here](https://getnotable.ai/n/RIo6On7oEB) (where I knew the [getnotable.ai](https://getnotable.ai/home) website from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16db0zp/comment/kgaohzo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), and these notes were summarized from [this](https://dev.to/marcbeaujean/should-new-developers-specialize-j46) dev.to post.

Common aspects to consider for each specialization, from most important to least important (in my opinion):

* Ethical and religious implications.
* Job market status.
	* Having a broad skillset can keep you open to more opportunities.
	* How niche is your specialization? (i.e., few local experts in this specialization, since it's hard to be acquired.)
	* Does this specialization have a high market demand?
* Worldly reasons.
	* Income (ðŸ’°ðŸ«°), pleasing others, status/fame/recognition, respect, etc.
* Passion.
	* We are not passionate about a job because of its detailed steps and mechanisms.
	* We are passionate about a job because of how it shapes us and solidifies our values.
* Capabilities.
	* How much can you efficiently apply the "[Constructivism](https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/develop/theory/constructivism.html)" learning theory? Can you properly incorporate newly gained information with past knowledge? 
	* Do you learn better from [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp9GhZXYWKAx7ynTHL4RC2f_g6LIlknTH) or [articles](https://medium.com/)/[papers](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/173pvsv/where_do_you_get_your_ai_news/)/[blogs](https://daily.dev/)?
	* Are you good at getting [very specific info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmnimxjaarM) from [barely known resources](https://www.youtube.com/@noone988-Ahmed-Fathi/playlists)?
* Job type.
	* IT jobs are [generally](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8sfo6e/comment/e0z844w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) CRUD jobs or kind-of-non-[CRUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4k7n9y/what_is_a_crud_job/) jobs.


## Knowledge Overlaps and Requirements Per Specialization

This sections answers:
- Which specialization is the most comprehensive and could help land a job in most tech fields?
	- Note that the job part of the question won't be discussed here, but the short answer:
		- In Egypt, remotely or on-site: SE.
		- Outside of Egypt:
			- Remotely: SE.
			- On-site: SE, but specific AI/IS data-related jobs are also prevalent, especially [Data Engineering](Data%20Engineering/Data%20Engineering.md).
- Which specialization is better if you want to work in embedded systems or robotics?
	- I will simply answer this here: in the BUE, I believe they're all not beneficial for embedded systems (as we've already taken that content before specializing). Moreover, for robotics, there's a subject in AI called "AI Planning and Robotics". However, ***until 2022***, it delved into the history and high-level knowledge about the origin of robotics, instead of practical tools/knowledge on how to implement systems for robotics. Check the headers of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/kpkne5/how_to_get_started_in_robotics_education_career/#:~:text=Programming%3A%20If%20you%20want%20to,bring%20while%20developing%20robotics%20software.) reddit answer to see what you might need to learn for this field.

This section is related to the `capabilities` and `job market` bullet points in [Mentality about Specialization Aspects](#Mentality%20about%20Specialization%20Aspects) section.

Quick English 101 recap:

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240131104055.png)

Now, regarding ICS specializations , I'll ***personally*** rank comprehensive sps from most comprehensive to least comprehensive by 2 aspects:

* How much they give you knowledge ***used by other specializations*** (implicitly or explicitly) (high to low):
	* CS (implicitly)
		* Can be thought an "origin of life" documentary for computing devices, so theoretically speaking, this knowledge is implicitly used in all other IT fields. Example: the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation#:~:text=In%20theoretical%20computer,computers%3F%22.%5B1%5D) module.
		* Discusses problems that are implicitly prevalent in all other IT fields like limitations of computers, time complexity, etc.
	* IS
		* 99% of IT jobs include working with data and managing data systems, so no matter your specialization/job, you'll most likely need a certain level of IS info (e.g., SQL, index types, etc.).
	* SE
		* Most IT jobs will require some form of software developed, so even if a company's required functionality is related to AI, security monitoring, etc., it will require a software program to host/display this functionality. A very small example of this is the web UI of [this](https://paragraph-miner.streamlit.app/) AI application, noting that this website is so small to the point that it doesn't require an SE graduate to do it ðŸ˜…. Nevertheless, it is an example of how SE-related knowledge can be used in other fields.
	* CN
		* Job examples include setting up the network infrastructure of a company to applying security protocols to secure the company's assets.
		* However, knowledge about basic principles of networking is a must, as different fields (AI/SE/...) require understanding of IP addresses, ports, domain names, firewall limitations, etc.
			* Not sure if detailed info about these topics are mentioned in depth in the BUE's CN specialization or not though. 
			* Either way, I personally think this info is enough to be obtained online, unless you're actually interested in network infrastructure/security, etc.
	* AI
		* Large overlap with IS based on the exact job role; Examples:
			* Data Engineering job.
			* Any other AI job, but only in the data processing section (in case you're using SQL, etc.).
		* Some AI jobs require understanding [cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-6cX0HRXh5nmyjDCAjxOyQtKGQ0SvME?usp=drive_link) related logic, which is very prevalent in SE.
		* I think the Math required for AI overlaps a little with that of CS, but I'm not sure of this.
		* Rarely overlaps with CN.
			* even the math of CN (security) requires info about number theory more than calculus, etc.
		* In general, some required knowledge for AI, specifically the Math, will probably not be needed anywhere else.

* How much they ***require knowledge*** to "mostly" grasp and understand their core concepts (high to low):
	* AI
		* How to process data (like in IS, and beyond that).
		* Domain knowledge about the business (to choose the right AI model) and about the topic of the data (e.g., biology if you're dealing with data in the medical field, etc.).
		* Math. Mainly, Linear Algebra and Calculus, but this is the least thing you need to understand out of the three. 
			* Unless you're planning be an academic researcher, work in R&D, or work in specific AI jobs that require developing AI models, which are relatively rare in Egypt.
	* CS
		* **Math**.
	* CN
		* Math. Mainly, number theory. I don't know what else to be honest.
		* If you're planning on walking the security path (specifically, hacking), then I guess you need to communicate in a sub-alien language which no one else understands except other security practitioners. [Example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akenofu_url-fuzzer-401403-bypass-activity-7151069471309258753-PdYN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
			* JK though, huge respect to these guys (don't hack me plz).
	* SE
		* Coding. I know all fields require coding, but I feel like SE really requires that you love coding, since it's literally all about how to engineer a coding solution for your software program/service/website.
		* Testing. Again, all fields require this, but in SE specifically, you'll most likely need to at least [unit test](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/types-of-software-testing/) your code. 
	* IS
		* Intuitive understanding of how to deal with data. Examples:
			* Sorted data is easier for lookups but harder for insertion/deletions.
			* if two people are accessing the same data, then there could be write conflicts/deadlocks.
			* If data processing is independent for each data point, then data can easily be processed parallelly across multiple devices.


Note about the "required knowledge" bullet point: this doesn't necessarily mean AI is the hardest and IS is the easiest, but it means, in my opinion, that AI is the most field that will simply require more time to mostly grasp, as you'll need to heavily apply the "[Constructivism](https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/develop/theory/constructivism.html)" learning theory previously talked about in the [Mentality about Specialization Aspects](#Mentality%20about%20Specialization%20Aspects) section.
