* Introduction
	* Introduce yourself + mention LinkedIn instead of ego boost.
	* If subtitles are found, they'll be inaccurate, the reason for this is mentioned at the end of the video.
	* If I talk slowly, reason is also mentioned at the end.
	* Most of the video is subjective.
* BUE Questions and Session Outline
	* The following questions are taken from an [excel sheet](https://livebueedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ashraf196280_bue_edu_eg/EYZW4Ai4aGZNkrS0gdYiAsEBPgNcs7-gevJxupUX4vQ-xQ?e=VbGmq7) I did a while back where I asked BUE students if they had any concerns with AI.
	* Mention that Microsoft Copilot summarized these questions and show them.
	* Mention the outline of the questions (by reading the top level bullet point of each summarized question).
* IT and BUE Specializations
	* For non-BUE students, mention that each university will have its own modules and naming conventions for IT related knowledge.
		* Example 1: GUC's [programs](https://www.guc.edu.eg/en/academic_programs/programs/):

		* Example 2: [AUC's Computer Science program](https://catalog.aucegypt.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=38&poid=6618).
		* Example 3: [Ain Shams' Computer Science specialization](https://asu2learn.asu.edu.eg/science/course/index.php?categoryid=14) in the Faculty of Science.
		* Example 4: obviously, the [BUE's ICS faculty](https://www.bue.edu.eg/faculty/informatics-computer-science/academic-programme):

		* Pro-tip: don't take the modules mentioned in any of the websites above to be up-to-date; always ask the faculty's staff.
	* Show your attempt of specifying each module in each specialization in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wExON8zV3sbf1hoipts_LsznLfMOWYJM9EPi7qAipwU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.843zzs6wkts) sheet, and the specializations related to each module in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SzKZXzVGHpCSpZO9bACl-XES3CoZFkIxDRLIOXJk5rY/edit) sheet.
	* 
* Closing remarks
	* State how planning things is a good soft-skill. For example, the bullet points here made the PowerPoint and the session concise.
	* Subtitles were made with whisper (have this [HF](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main) tab and [whisper](https://github.com/jhj0517/Whisper-WebUI?tab=readme-ov-file#whisper-webui) [application](https://github.com/Pikurrot/whisper-gui?tab=readme-ov-file) on standby).
	* Ask to share if they find the video useful, and to [message you](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashrafharess/) if they have any feedback or questions.
