The following [questions](https://livebueedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ashraf196280_bue_edu_eg/EYZW4Ai4aGZNkrS0gdYiAsEBPgNcs7-gevJxupUX4vQ-xQ?e=VbGmq7) are taken from an excel sheet I did a while back where I asked BUE students if they had any concerns with AI, but since there are questions related to the practical side of computer science, I added this note to [Applied Sciences](../../Applied%20Sciences.md) instead of [Formal Sciences](../../../Formal%20Sciences/Formal%20Sciences.md) :\].

Now, the questions as of #2024-01-31  were summarized by [Microsoft's copilot](https://youtu.be/5rEZGSFgZVY?t=38) as:

1. **Choosing a Specialization**
    - What is the mentality needed to determine which specialization to pick?
    - If interested in two majors, how to choose between them?
    - Which specialization is the most comprehensive and could help land a job in most tech fields?
    - Which specialization realistically gets most opportunities to travel outside Egypt?
    - Which specialization is better if you want to work in embedded systems or robotics?
    - What is the most optimal and easiest specialization to help land a remote job?
2. **AI vs SE vs CS vs IS**
    - What is the difference between SE, CS, and IS if looking for a job in these fields (web front and/or back, mobile, cloud)?
    - Can I study both web dev and mobile dev and/or any other field with uni and be able to grasp the content?
3. **AI Specialization**
    - Is the education from uni enough for AI or do I need extra courses?
    - What are the important courses for AI?
    - Is 3D Gaming an optional in AI or removed?
    - In the AI optional modules, is the module called humanoid robots interesting and what exactly do we do in it?
    - What math should I know before going through AI?
    - Can I balance SE and AI courses?
4. **SE Specialization**
    - If my Java skills are not the best, will I face any difficulties in SE?
    - How heavy is coding in SE?
    - What are the important courses for SE?
5. **Job Market**
    - Will I find a good job? If yes, what’s the minimum salary?
    - Are the jobs in AI as interesting as the topics?
    - Are there good and many jobs for the AI department in the Egyptian market?
    - Can graduates find jobs easily?
    - What jobs are there for AI graduates in the Egyptian market?
    - What jobs are there for SE graduates in the Egyptian market?
    - Does choosing a specific major make you lose out on many job opportunities?
    - For a specific sector like AI security, which major would be better?
    - Is there a huge gap between college modules and the work field (are the skills we learn in uni enough to land a job)?
    - Since the job market in tech is tough right now and companies are not hiring fresh grads like they used to in 2020-2022, how many jobs exist right now for SE and AI?
    - How much experience is needed to land a job in development and SE specializations?
6. **Graduation Projects**
    - How are graduation projects in SE, CS, IS, and AI like? Are they all group projects and how do they look like?
7. **Prerequisites**
    - What are the prerequisites for SE, AI, CS, and IS specializations so we don’t go in blind?
8. **Cross-specialization Modules**
    - If I want to take some AI modules if I am in SE, can I do that?
9. **Masters Programs**
    - What are the available masters programs in AI field and which are the highest in demand to land a job?
10. **Personal Experience**
    - What made you pick AI? What was your goal and how did you reverse engineer it to reach it?

Now,

**Presentation preparation**:

At first, I was searching for an AI tool that will help me generate slides based on the bullet points above, so it was either [slidemaker](https://www.slidemake.com/) (which I knew from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/11qj9ba/i_created_an_aipowered_powerpoint_maker_to/?sort=new)), or [gamma.app](https://gamma.app/) (which I knew from [there's an ai for that](https://theresanaiforthat.com/presentation-slides/?ref=suggest&sort=most-saved)), or [prezo.ai](https://prezo.ai/) (also from there's an ai for that), but then I decided to choose gamma.app:
