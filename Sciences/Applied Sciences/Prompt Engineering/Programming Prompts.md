## Function Docstring

create `pdoc` compatible documentation for this function with explanation section explaining what the code does (you don't have to explain each line of code). Also, write the function definition only if you'll add typed parameters and return values, but DO NOT write "# function implementation..." in your answer; just write the docstring, and make it tab indented so that i can directly paste it inside the function. Also, make sure to retain the general logic of the initial docstring (if found).

...

and to also write the function header in case there are typed parameters or return values to be added, and make sure that the return value is `Optional[...]` (if there's an `inplace` parameter).

Note: "this function" refers to the fact that I'm currently highlighting the function to be modified in VSCode.
