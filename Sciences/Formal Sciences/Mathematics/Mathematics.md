# About Mathematics

Mathematics (or simply, Math), is interpreted with multiple definitions (source: Oxford Languages):
* It is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as:
	* abstract concepts ( _pure mathematics_ )
	* or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering ( _applied mathematics_).
* It is the language of the universe ([source 1](https://medium.com/predict/mathematics-the-language-of-the-universe-47325ade387), [source 2](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/why-mathematics-is-the-ultimate-language-of-the-universe-bf99d8a6245f), both from Medium).
* It is the most fundamental science.

# Mind Maps of Mathematics

Since [Mathematics is rooted in a lot of other sciences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/15269/chapter/5#64:~:text=FIGURE%203%2D2%20The%20mathematical%20sciences%20and%20their%20interfaces%20in%202013.%20The%20number%20of%20interfaces%20has%20increased%20since%20the%20time%20of%20Figure%203%2D1%2C%20and%20the%20mathematical%20sciences%20themselves%20have%20broadened%20in%20response.), it can't be fully visualized in a single mind map. Therefore, we will showcase a few mind map examples:

*  [Margie Hale's](https://www2.stetson.edu/~mhale/logic/tree.htm) pure Math tree (personal favorite):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201090953.png)
  
  Such that orange/green/yellow "fruits" refer to Algebra/Geometry/Analysis respectively.
  
* High-level overview of Mathematics ([source: gogeometry.com](https://gogeometry.com/education/mathematics_fields_mind_map.html)):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201085602.png)
  
* Daniel Tubbenhauer's pure Math mind map ([source](https://www.dtubbenhauer.com/Talk-Dublin-2020.pdf)):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201092409.png)
  
  
* quantumazaine's Interactive map focusing on a few Math terminologies/problems/historical-milestones under the terms "numbers", "shapes", and "change" can be found [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-map-of-mathematics-20200213/).
  
* "The map of Mathematics" ([source: Domain of Science's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y)):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201085823.png)
  
* Displaying some terminologies of each sub-field ([source: edrawmind](https://www.edrawmind.com/mind-maps/11525/maths-study)):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201090131.png)
* Displaying Math concepts as "skills" of concepts to be learned ([source: edrawmind](https://www.edrawmind.com/mind-maps/12298/mathematical-skills)):
  
  ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020231201090335.png)
* Other mind maps are mentioned [here](https://www.edrawmind.com/mind-maps/education/maths/page-1), and [here](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-diagram-or-tree-of-all-fields-of-mathematics-or-mathematics-evolution).


Unfortunately, there aren't many clear mind maps for applied Math (other than gogeometry's map mentioned at the start of [Mind Maps of Mathematics](#Mind%20Maps%20of%20Mathematics) section, which focuses more on mathematical concepts than can be applied in other sciences. 

However, regarding other sciences in which Math can be applied, there is this mind map ([source: colorado.edu](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/academics/undergraduate-program/applied-math-major-bs/recommended-options-applied-math-majors)):

And this list of math-related sciences ([source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics#Associated_mathematical_sciences)):
* Engineering and technological engineering
* Scientific computing
* Computer science
* Operations research and management science
* Actuarial science
* Mathematical economics
* Other, more general fields include: business, physics, chemistry, psychology, biology, information theory, and mathematical physics.

This Venn-diagram also depicts how Math is incredibly prevalent in other [sciences](../../Science.md) ([source: Vinay Kumar on ResearchGate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272852982_Mathematics_Is_Science_A_Topic_Revisited_in_Context_of_FCS_of_India)):
