Note that the order of some content is changed in this version, as mentioned [here](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/preface-2.html). Moreover, when I mention "s1" in my math notes, I will sometimes refer to the UBC edition.

## Line

A ***line*** is a ray that is _straight_ and _infinite_ in both directions ([s1](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/systems-of-linear-equations.html#defn-lines)).

Example:

## Plane

A ***plane*** is a flat sheet that is infinite in all directions ([s1](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/systems-of-linear-equations.html#definition-11)).

Example:
