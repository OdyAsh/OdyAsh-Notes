# Algebra Definition

* Algebra is the study of variables, the rules for manipulating these variables in formulas, and solving equations. 
* Originating in ancient Babylonian techniques of calculation, it is now a way of thinking that appears throughout almost all areas of mathematics.
* Deals with mathematical expressions
	* symbols
	* coefficients
	* variables.
- Covers topics like polynomials, inequalities, functions, and mathematical modeling using algebra.
- Mostly **focuses on computations and procedural manipulation**.

# Algebra Mind Maps

There are many branches of Algebra, so the following lists are probably not comprehensive, but rather what's generally seen when searching the internet.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_algebra):
- [Abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra")
- [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra")
- [Elementary algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_algebra "Elementary algebra")
- [Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra")
- [Pre-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-algebra "Pre-algebra")
- [Universal algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra "Universal algebra")

According to [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-branches-of-algebra#:~:text=Lots%20of%20things%20in%20math) Quora answer (most comprehensive):
* Abstract Algebra
	* Studies abstract algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields.
	- Examines abstract properties and axioms of mathematical objects.
	- Relies heavily on formal proofs and set theory.
	- Significantly more theoretical and abstract than algebra or linear algebra.
	- Topics include groups, subgroups, quotient groups, homomorphisms, and isomorphisms.
* Algebraic Combinatorics
* Algebraic Geometry
* Algebraic Number Theory
* Algebraic Topology
* Algebras in Category Theory
* Boolean Algebra
* Clifford Algebras
* Elementary Algebra
* Linear Algebra
	* Involves the study of vectors and vector spaces.
	- Analyzes systems of linear equations, matrices, transformations, and eigenvalues.
	- Provides foundational math concepts for fields like machine learning, computer graphics, and data analysis.
	- More abstract and **focuses on proving theorems than computation**.
* Tensor Calculus
