# Linear Algebra Definition

source: Wikipedia

* Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") and [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map). 
	* It is also concerned with their representations in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)").
* Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For example:
	* [Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry")
	* [Functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis")
* Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models.


# Linear Algebra Mind Maps

Mind map of Math basics and how they relate to **geometric** and **computational aspects** of linear algebra:

About the mind map above: The skills from high school math you need to “import” to your study of linear algebra are geometry, functions, and the tricks for solving systems of equations.

Mind map of Linear Algebra's applications:
