# About Computer Science

source 1: Wikipedia

* Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
* Computer science spans [theoretical disciplines to applied disciplines](../../Science.md#Branches%20of%20Science%20(Academic%20Disciplines)).
* Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.

## ACM CCS (Computing Classification System)

One well known subject classification system for computer science is the [ACM Computing Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Computing_Classification_System "ACM Computing Classification System")  (personal recommendation), which is devised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery"). It contains the following (incomplete; has only 2 levels of nesting out of possibly 4 levels):
- Applied computing
	- Arts and humanities
	- Computer forensics
	- Computers in other domains
	- Document management and text processing
