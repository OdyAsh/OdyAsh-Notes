## ACM CCS (Computing Classification System)

One well known subject classification system for computer science is the [ACM Computing Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Computing_Classification_System "ACM Computing Classification System")  (personal recommendation, can be accessed [here](https://dl.acm.org/ccs)), which is devised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery").
