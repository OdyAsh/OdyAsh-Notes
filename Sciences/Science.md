# Science Definition

* the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation, experimentation, and the testing of theories against the evidence obtained. (source: Oxford Languages). Can be further divided to: ([source: Medium](https://medium.com/@kumar111aakash.in/from-intuition-to-empirical-data-ancient-science-vs-modern-science-and-technology-b249a975de0b))
	* Ancient science: based on observations, trial and error, and intuition.
	* Modern science: based on empirical data, systematic experimentation, and rigorous analysis.
* knowledge of any kind.

# Branches of Science (Academic Disciplines)

People have categorized sub-types of science in multiple ways. However, we'll mention this mind map to illustrate the branches of science  ([source: MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/1023614692/branches-ofscience), based on this [source: wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science)):

Side note 1: the mind map above is not a comprehensive list. In other words, "social sciences" contain many more sub-fields than those stated in the mind map, etc. 

Side note 2: the relation between science branches and their sub-fields isn't a one to one (1:1) relationship. For example, computer science is primarily considered as a formal science and is also considered an applied science. More details here, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#:~:text=Computer%20science%20spans%20theoretical%20disciplines), and [here](https://www.quora.com/Is-computer-science-pure-science-or-just-applied-science#:~:text=So%20it%27s%20both%20at%20once%2C%20and%20more.%20CS%20sub%2Dfields%20lean%20in%20all%20sorts%20of%20directions%3A%20pure%20science%2C%20engineering%20or%20even%20abstract%20math.%20Sometimes%20they%20even%20veer%20into%20art!). Also, another Wikipedia article labels computer science [as a formal science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines#Business:~:text=Formal%20science%5B,%5Bedit%5D) and [as an applied science](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines#Business:~:text=(outline)-,Computer%20science,-Control%20systems%20engineering>).

From Wikipedia:
-  [fundamental sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_science "Fundamental science"):
	- form the basis of [interdisciplinarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity")
	- are branched to:
		- [Formal sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science): the study of [formal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system"), such as those under the branches of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), which use an _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_, as opposed to [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence"), [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology").
		- [Social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"): the study of [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior "Human behavior") in its social and cultural aspects.
		- [Natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"): the study of natural phenomena (including [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological "Cosmological"), [geological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological "Geological"), [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), and [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological "Biological") factors of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe")). Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [physical science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_physical_science "Outline of physical science") and [life science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_life_sciences "List of life sciences") (or [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology")).
- [applied sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science"):
	- sciences that apply other branches of science (e.g., formal sciences, natural sciences, etc.).
	- Examples: [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") and [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine").


A more detailed Wikipedia page can be accessed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines), where it outlines detailed academic disciplines of each science branch (with the addition of "humanities" as a branch).

In general, these are the 4 branches that usually come across when searching the internet:
* Formal Sciences
* Social Sciences
* Natural Sciences
* Applied Sciences

# Pseudoscience

(source: Oxford Languages)

Pseudoscience is a collection of beliefs or practices mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method.

Examples can be found in Wikipedia's ["List of topics characterized as pseudoscience" article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience). Note: Not all the topics listed there are pseudoscience. In other words, there is a room for error/ambiguity, so please double-check any doubts that you have about a listed topic.
