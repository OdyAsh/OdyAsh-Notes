[source 1: lawinsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/social-sorting)

Social sorting definitions include:
* the process of assigning people to different categories/worth/risk in a way that has significant impact on their life chances.
* Obtaining personal and group data in order to classify people and populations according to varying criteria, to determine who should be targeted for special treatment, suspicion, eligibility, inclusion, etc.
* Unequal treatment of different groups of people which produces unfavorable outcomes for those who are ultimately disenfranchised (i.e., deprived) by being placed at the bottom of the sorting.
