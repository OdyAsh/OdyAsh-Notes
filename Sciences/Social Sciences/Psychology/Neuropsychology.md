# Definition

Neuropsychology is a branch of [basic psychology](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_science_(psychology)>) that relates the nervous system (e.g., the brain) with a person's [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) and [behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior) functions ([s1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology#)). From now on, we will refer to this relationship as the "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">N-C-B relationship</mark>", where N-C-B is a self-made abbreviation which stands for neuron-cognition-behavior.

From the perspective of [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) ([علوم عصبية](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85_%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9)), neuropsychology is considered a branch of [cognitive neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience) ([علم الأعصاب المعرفي](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%8A)) (which is a branch of neuroscience) ([s1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience#Major_branches)).

The main difference between neuropsychology and other branches of psychology lies in its <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">emphasis on the biological basis of behavior</mark> ([s1, AI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Neuropsychology)).

 Neuropsychology is both an experimental and clinical field of patient-focused psychology.  
 
 Let's break down the above sentence:
 
* Experimental psychology ([source: CSP Global](https://online.csp.edu/resources/article/what-is-experimental-psychology/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Experimental%20Psychology%3F))
	* Experimental psychology is a branch of basic psychology.
	* It is a method of studying psychology by using empirical research methods to explore and better understand behavior.
	* This work allows findings to be employed in real-world applications (applied psychology) across fields such as ***clinical***/educational/forensic/sports/social psychology.
* Clinical psychology ([source: Alliant International University](https://www.alliant.edu/blog/what-clinical-psychology#:~:text=What%20is%20Clinical%20Psychology%3F))
	* Clinical psychology is a branch of [applied psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_psychology).
	* It is a method of applying psychological research in "clinical" settings.
	* It is simply defined as "the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">with the intention of promoting change</mark>" ([source: The Psychological Clinic paper by Witmer](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/32349#Early_clinical_psychology).
		* This is why "patient-focused psychology" was mentioned in defining neuropsychology.
	* Scientific research (established in experimental psychology) is relevant to clinical practice because it provides detailed and accurate knowledge about psychological problems and determines whether treatments are effective ([source: PB Pressbooks](https://opentext.wsu.edu/carriecuttler/chapter/experimental-and-clinical-psychologists/#:~:text=Scientific%20research%20is%20relevant%20to%20clinical%20practice%20because%20it%20provides%20detailed%20and%20accurate%20knowledge%20about%20psychological%20problems%20and%20establishes%20whether%20treatments%20are%20effective.)).

Since it's patient-focused, this N-C-B relationship is studied to understand the C-B effects of neurological disorders () in order to properly diagnose and treat them ([s1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology#:~:text=thus%20aiming%20to%20understand%20how%20behavior%20and%20cognition%20are%20influenced%20by%20brain%20function%20and%20concerned%20with%20the%20diagnosis%20and%20treatment%20of%20behavioral%20and%20cognitive%20effects%20of%20neurological%20disorders.)).
