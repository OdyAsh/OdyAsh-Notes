# Dopamine Definition

(s1)

Dopamine is a small molecule called a neurotransmitter: 

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240630075609.png)

It helps our neurons and brain cells communicate with each other.

It's involved in:
* Movement
* Sleep
* Mood
* Reward
* Motivation

In our brain's reward system, dopamine is the main currency that motivates us to actually do stuff.

# Dopamine Generation

## Tonic Transmission

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Tonic transmission</mark> is when the neurons are randomly and continuously releasing small amounts of dopamine, setting your <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">baseline dopamine level</mark>.

## Phasic Transmission

Phasic transmission is when neurons generate a surge of dopamine when a specific event happens (also called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cocktail party effect</mark>).

## Real Life Example

* You get a notification from your phone, saying that someone reacted to your post.
	* This is called a cue, which causes a moderate [Phasic Transmission](#Phasic%20Transmission).
* If you see that the number of likes is more/same as/less than expected, then this will cause a high/empty/negative phasic transmission.
	* Note: the first and third case scenarios are called a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reward prediction error</mark>.
		* In other words, not expecting a certain outcome will lead to a phasic transmission.

Now, if these phasic transmissions happen too often, it will lead to the rise of [tonic transmissions](#Tonic%20Transmission), which will make future phasic transmissions not stand out:

When that happens, you'll need to seek out more rewards to get that same joy from phasic transmissions, and this state is called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dopamine deficit state</mark>.

# Random Intermittent Reward

* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Random intermittent rewards</mark> are rewarding content shown to you at random intervals of time.
	* E.g., a random good post in the middle of scrolling through Facebook.
* These ensure occasional [phasic transmissions](#Phasic%20Transmission).

# Dopamine Detox

* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Dopamine detox</mark> means detoxing from dopamine inducing activities, not from dopamine itself.
* In other words, it means <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"learning to enjoy the simple pleasures of life"</mark> :].

## Rules to Ensure Dopamine Detox

1. The rule of pain before pleasure
	1. Remember the seesaw analogy:
	   
	   ![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240630142817.png)
	   
		1. When pleasure is weighted (overused), the pain will rise (i.e., surface in the brain), and so the brain will want to return the equilibrium
		2. When pain is weighted, pleasure will rise
			1. This can be done by doing tough activities first (e.g., finishing a project, exercising, etc.) before doing a "fun" activity.
2. The rule of avoidance
	1. For a period of time (preferably around 4 weeks), avoid the addictive behavior all together, which can be done by removing reminders of addictions as well.
3. The rule of barriers
	1. Types of barriers:

4. Rule of boredom
	1. Be comfortable about being bored.
	2. "The goal is to be bored".
	3. When you intentionally accept boredom, the brain enters a [default network mode (DNM)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Default_mode_network) which allows for creativity.
