# Definition

#hyperfocus  #monotopic-learning  #polytropic-learning

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hyperfocus</mark> refers to an intense fixation on an interest or activity for an extended period of time. People who experience hyperfocus often become so engrossed they block out the world around them ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=Hyperfocus%20refers%20to%20an%20intense%20fixation%20on%20an%20interest%20or%20activity%20for%20an%20extended%20period%20of%20time.%20People%20who%20experience%20hyperfocus%20often%20become%20so%20engrossed%20they%20block%20out%20the%20world%20around%20them.)).


More formally, it¬†is an intense form of¬†[mental](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mind "Mind")¬†[concentration](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention "Attention")¬†or¬†[visualization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Creative_visualization "Creative visualization")¬†that focuses¬†[consciousness](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Consciousness "Consciousness")¬†on a subject, topic, or task ([s1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus)). 

When you hyperfocus on a task, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">you expand that task</mark> until it fills your [attentional space](#Attentional%20Space) completely. 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Hyperfocus on a certain subject can cause side-tracking away from assigned or important tasks</mark>.

Psychiatrically, it is primarily considered to be a symptom (i.e., indication) of [ADHD](ADHD%20-%20Attention-Deficit%20Hyperactive%20Disorder.md)¬†together with inattention. It's also considered a trait of [other disorders](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus#:~:text=such%20as%20schizophrenia%2C%20and%20autism%20spectrum%20disorder%20(ASD).>).

It's a [negatively-connotated](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-negative-connotation-definition/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20define%20negative%20connotation) synonym of [monotropic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monotropism) learning, which is the opposite of polytropic learning:

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240313080909.png)

([s1](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus#:~:text=Monotropic%20(hyperfocus)%20and%20polytropic%20learning>))

Hyperfocus has 4 stages:
- Choose something to focus on.
- Eliminate as many external/internal distractions as you can
- Focus on that chosen object of attention 
- Continually draw your focus back to that one object of attention
	- This process is called [metacognition](#Managing%20Your%20Attentional%20Space).

# Hyperfocus vs Flow

When our skills exceed the demands of a task ‚Äî we feel bored.
When the demands of a task exceed our skills ‚Äî we feel anxious.
When the demands of a task are roughly equal to our ability ‚Äî we‚Äôre more likely to be fully engaged. Also known as the [Flow](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow) State ([s3](https://wolcan.medium.com/hyperfocus-97c76df3754d#:~:text=When%20our%20skills%20exceed%20the%20demands%20of%20a%20task)).

# Hyperfocus vs Scatterfocus

#scatterfocus  #diffuse-mode  #connecting-the-dots  #big-picture 

Hyperfocus :
* Is the brain‚Äôs most productive mode ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=is%20the%20brain%E2%80%99s%20most%20productive%20mode)).
* Allows you to stay focused on one problem and execute ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#main-takeaways)).

Scatterfocus:
* Is the brain's most creative mode ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=is%20the%20brain%E2%80%99s%20most%20productive%20mode)).
* Is also called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">‚Äúdiffuse mode‚Äù</mark> (from "[A Mind for Numbers](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-a-mind-for-numbers/#:~:text=Focused%20vs%20Diffused%20Thinking)") ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=the%20%E2%80%9Cdiffuse%20mode%E2%80%9D%20from%20A%20Mind%20for%20Numbers)).
* Helps you recharge, improve creativity, and your ability to set intentions ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=helps%20you%20to%20recharge%2C%20in%20addition%20to%20improving%20creativity%20and%20ability%20to%20set%20intentions.)).
* Bailey: ‚ÄúBoredom is really just unwanted scatterfocus.‚Äù
* Three styles of scatterfocus ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=The%20three%20styles%20of%20scatterfocus)):
	* **Capture mode**: Letting the mind roam freely and capturing the thoughts that come up ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=Letting%20the%20mind%20roam%20freely%20and%20capturing%20the%20thoughts%20that%20come%20up)).
	* **Problem-Crunching Mode**: Holding a single problem in the mind and letting your mind wander around it, connecting its dots (but not focusing intensely on it).
		* A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dot</mark> is any idea or piece of information that you remember ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=any%20idea%20or%20piece%20of%20information%20that%20you%20rememember)).
	* **Habitual Mode**: Doing a simple, habit-based tasks that doesn‚Äôt take up nearly all your attentional space, and allowing the mind to wander during that time.
		* Best both for recharging and for connecting the greatest number of ideas or ‚Äúdots‚Äù
		* Main difference between Problem-Crunching Mode and this mode is that in this mode you let your mind wander freely instead of continually bring your thoughts back to the problem ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=Main%20difference%20between%20Problem%2DCrunching%20Mode%20and%20this%20mode%3A%20in%20Problem%2DCrunching%20Mode%2C%20you%20continually%20bring%20your%20thoughts%20back%20to%20the%20problem%2C%20while%20in%20Habitual%20Mode%2C%20you%20let%20your%20mind%20wander%20freely.)).

It is worthwhile to learn how to deliberately enter both modes multiple times a day ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#main-takeaways)), and that they're anti-correlated ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#:~:text=How%20hyperfocus%20helps%20you%20scatterfocus)).

# Symptoms

From what I deduce, the following are indications of having hyperfocus disorder:
* Side-tracking away from assigned or important tasks due to concentration on other tasks or interests.
* Giving unplanned, unwanted, and extended period of time for an interesting task or topic. Examples:
	* For children, the object of hyperfocus¬†might be playing a video game or watching TV.
	* Adults might hyperfocus on social media or shopping.
		* In one extraordinary case history, cited by [Kathleen Nadeau](https://www.additudemag.com/author/kathleen-nadeau-ph-d/), a woman with ADHD was so focused on a project that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">she failed to notice that her house had caught fire</mark> üî•üèöÔ∏è ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=In%20one%20extraordinary%20case%20history%2C%20cited%20by%20Nadeau%2C%20a%20woman%20with%20ADHD%20was%20so%20focused%20on%20a%20project%20that%20she%20failed%20to%20notice%20that%20her%20house%20had%20caught%20fire.)).
	* whatever holds the attention, the result is the same: Unless something or someone interrupts, hours drift by as important tasks and relationships fall by the wayside.
* Difficulty of shifting attention from an interesting activity to a another activity ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=why%20you%20should%20allow%20a%20few%20minutes%20for%20the%20shift%20in%20attention%20to%20occur.%20It%E2%80%99s%20almost%20like%20pulling%20someone%20out%20of%20a%20dream.)) (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">It's as if you're getting pulled out of a dream</mark>).


# Causes

#dopamine 
#ÿßŸÑÿØŸàÿ®ÿßŸÖŸäŸÜ 

Hyperfocus is thought to result from the following:
* Abnormally low levels of dopamine
	* Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is particularly active in the brain‚Äôs frontal lobes.
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">This dopamine deficiency makes it hard to ‚Äúshift gears‚Äù to take up boring-but-necessary tasks</mark>.
	* Side note: this is also the case for [distractibility](https://www.additudemag.com/distractibility-not-just-an-adhd-thing/)
* The need of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a coping mechanism</mark> ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=such%20intense%20concentration%20is%20actually%20a%20coping%20mechanism.)).
	* This is implicitly explained in this section: [Emotional Discomfort](Sciences/Social%20Sciences/Psychology/Psychological%20Disorders/Neurodevelopmental%20Disorders/ADHD/Hyperfocus.md#Emotional%20Discomfort).

Other reasons are mentioned in the "[Lower Attention Span - Causes and Solutions](#Lower%20Attention%20Span%20-%20Causes%20and%20Solutions)" section.

# Managing Your Hyperfocus

For adults with ADHD, managing [Bouts](../../../../../../Personal%20Dictionary/en-US/Bouts.md) of hyperfocus <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">requires setting up external cues to redirect their attention</mark> ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=How%20Can%20I%20Train%20My%20ADHD%20Hyperfocus%3F)).

Examples:

On Windows, follow the steps here make focus sessions always on top of your screen when doing tasks; hopefully that will decrease the odds of you getting distracted:
![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240320064037.png)

Internal distractions (like random thoughts) should be written down in a to do list (e.g., Microsoft To Do), or a calendar app (e.g., the amazing [FlowSavvy](https://my.flowsavvy.app/join/pGDPuh) app).

Moreover, check [this](#Lower%20Attention%20Span%20-%20Causes%20and%20Solutions) section to see different causes of and solutions to a lower attention span, which partially overlap with some negative side effects of hyperfocus, like <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">side tracking from the main task</mark>.

# Related Terminologies

Most of the following sub-sections are mainly from the book mentioned in the book: "Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More" by Chris Bailey (s3), unless I explicitly mentioned a source other than s3.

## Productivity Definition

* Productivity means accomplishing what we intend to do ([s3](https://wolcan.medium.com/hyperfocus-97c76df3754d#:~:text=Productivity%20means%20accomplishing%20what%20we%20intend%20to%20do.%20Being%20busy%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20make%20us%20productive.%20It%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20matter%20how%20busy%20we%20are%20if%20that%20busyness%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20lead%20us%20to%20accomplish%20anything%20of%20importance.%20Productivity%20is%20not%20about%20cramming%20more%20into%20our%20days%20but%20about%20doing%20the%20right%20thing%20each%20moment)).
* Being busy doesn‚Äôt make us productive. 
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Productivity is not about cramming more into our days but about doing the right thing each moment</mark>.

## Types of Tasks

#matrix-of-task-types

Types of tasks (s3 [here](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#chapter-switching-off-autopilot-mode), [here](https://wolcan.medium.com/hyperfocus-97c76df3754d#7cfd) and [here](https://dev.to/mark_nicol/notes-on-hyperfocus-73j#:~:text=Boring%20is%20a%20sign%20that%20it%20isn%27t%20occupying%20your%20full%20attention)):

|              | Unattractive | Attractive  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| Productive   | Necessary    | Purposeful  |
| Unproductive | Unnecessary  | Distracting |

Each day, all four quadrants (task types) compete for our attention. The more we‚Äôre on autopilot, the more time we‚Äôll spend in the wrong quadrants.
Takeaways ([s3](https://thomasjfrank.com/productivity/books/hyperfocus-by-chris-bailey-summary-and-notes/#chapter-switching-off-autopilot-mode:~:text=Each%20day%2C%20all,throughout%20the%20day.)): 
* Develop this ability: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">intentionality</mark> about where you place your focus. 
	* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Take more reset breaks</mark> in order to gain <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">this</mark> ability back (recharge it) when needed throughout the day.

## Types of Distractions

Four types of distractions:

|            | Annoying                                                                                                | Fun                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Control | Deal with, get back on track. <br>Examples:<br>loud surroundings, meetings.                             | Enjoy! <br>Examples:<br>Calls from loved ones.                                                                      |
| Control    | Deal with ahead of time.<br>Examples:<br>Emails, some meetings, phone alerts, random negative thoughts. | Deal with ahead of time. <br>Examples:<br>News websites, social media, instant messaging, random positive thoughts. |


## Traction and Distraction

#tractions  #distractions

A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">traction</mark> is an important activity that'll make your life a lot better if you could focus on them better (also defined [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traction#:~:text=the%20support%20or%20interest%20that%20is%20needed%20for%20something%20to%20make%20progress%20or%20succeed)). A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distraction</mark> is a behavior that moves you away from the traction ([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf), which is inspired from [Nir Eyal](https://nireyal.medium.com/knowing-the-difference-between-traction-and-distraction-will-change-your-life-this-year-dc085e7a6a21)).


## Attentional Space

#attentional-space  #attentional-capacity

Chris Bailey defines <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attentional space</mark> as ([source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hyper-focus-chris-bailey-juan-carlos-zambrano/#:~:text=MEET%20YOUR%20ATTENTIONAL%20SPACE)):
* the ***amount of mental capacity*** we have available to focus on and process things in the moment.
* the scratch pad or **clipboard** in our brain that we use to temporarily store information as it‚Äôs being processed.

Attentional space (i.e., <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attentional capacity</mark>):

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240320073521.png)

Note: In the image above, notice how doing a complex task, like writing, occupies more of your attentional space.

### Managing Your Attentional Space

#meta-awareness  #metacognition  #attentional-residue

We mustn't overuse our attentional space if we want our [attention span](#Attention%20Span) to improve ([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf)).

If it got overused, i.e., the attentional space is a bit too full,, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">write down the less complex tasks/habits so you can deal with them later, or diffuse by having occasional breaks</mark>.

Ok, but why leave some space? to gain two things ([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf)):
* To leave room for ***reflecting on the the best approach*** to completing the task, so you can work smarter and avoid the autopilot mode.
* To have greater awareness of where you should be directing your attention in the first place (mentioned below as "meta-awareness"), so you can also refocus if your mind wanders in the middle of a task.


Assuming it's not full, follow the following steps as well:

* Leave some spare room in your attentional space to add [meta-awareness](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/schooler/jonathan/sites/labs.psych.ucsb.edu.schooler.jonathan/files/pubs/meta-awareness.pdf) (a subset of "[metacognition](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Metacognition#:~:text=Metacognition%20is%20an%20awareness%20of%20one%27s%20thought%20processes)")
	* Noting that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meta-awareness</mark> means <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the process of directing attention</mark> toward the contents of consciousness, thereby evaluating the contents of consciousness (which is metacognition).

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240320115000.png)

([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf))

* Prevent <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attentional residue</mark>, which is the cost we pay when switching from one task to another, particularly if we haven't finished the first task.
	* For example, imagine you're in the middle of writing an important email. Suddenly, your phone rings. As you pick it up and start a conversation, a part of your mind is still thinking about the email. This is attentional residue at play. 

![](Media-Temp/Pasted%20image%2020240320120524.png)

([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf))


## Attention Span

 #attention-span

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Attention span</mark> is defined as ([source](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention_span#:~:text=Attention%20span%20is%20the%20amount%20of%20time%20spent%20concentrating%20on%20a%20task%20before%20becoming%20distracted.)):
* the ***amount of time spent*** concentrating on a task before becoming distracted.

Side note regarding the myth of shorter attention span in newer generations ([s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf?gi=3011672ed6d0)):
* Apparently, the human attention span isn't necessarily crumbling across newer generations (debunked [here](https://policyviz.com/2016/01/29/the-attention-span-statistic-fallacy/)). In fact, I personally think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1380ixn/comment/jivzymx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) reddit comment summarizes generation Z perfectly :].
	* E.g., <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a smartphone gives you the means to distract yourself. However, the root cause of that distraction is something else</mark>.
	* "Most people don‚Äôt want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. How we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines whether we pursue healthful acts of traction or self-defeating distractions." ([source](https://www.charlottegrysolle.com/blog-its-not-technology-its-you/#managing-internal-triggers-is-key): Nir Eyal)

### Lower Attention Span - Causes and Solutions

The following are some of the reasons why our attention spans are shorter than desired, and possible solutions for each cause. Most of the info in these subsections are from this amazing source: [s3](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-increase-your-attention-span-b29b2ffa51cf?gi=3011672ed6d0).

#### Lack of Purpose or Intention

#self-restart
#ÿØŸàÿ±ÿ©-ÿ•ÿπÿßÿØÿ©-ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ-ÿßŸÑÿ∞ÿßÿ™ 
#purpose
#ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸáÿØÿßŸÅ 
#ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿßŸäÿßÿ™ 
#tractions
#distractions 

Problems:
* Do you even know why you want better focus?
* Attention without intention is wasted energy.
	* Personal note: this lines up perfectly with the why-what-how triad of the Arabic program "[self-restart](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lotfieltokhi_%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-activity-7128019975436480513-_cC_/)".

Solutions:
* Don't focus so that you wear the "I can focus!" badge of honor :].
	* Recalling the "[self-restart](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lotfieltokhi_%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%BA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-activity-7128019975436480513-_cC_/)" program, recall that the series of purposes should be traced back to "ÿ±ÿ∂Ÿâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá".
* Accordingly, find your [tractions](#Traction%20and%20Distraction). 

#### Novelty Bias

#novelty-bias
#having-fun-with-a-task
#big-picture
#connecting-the-dots 
#micro-distractions

Problems:
* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Novelty bias</mark> is the tendency for an intervention to appear better when it is new ([source](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/28/6/410)).
* It gives you dopamine boosts when you switch to a new task, browser tab, or TV channel.

Solutions:

Regarding tractions, you can introduce novelty to your current traction by having fun with it. How?: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To have fun with a task</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">means to reimagine or change your approach to it</mark>, which can be done by embracing it and approaching its challenges as a game. 

* For example, I've taken it upon myself to conquer the following challenge while writing these notes: Relate as much different concepts and terminologies as possible and tie them together to properly define why one enters a negative hyperfocus state and how to overcome it; this <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">big picture</mark> of connected dots is fun to me :].
* In that same example, another challenge is that while I'm connecting the dots, I should minimize deviations/distractions as much as possible :].

Regarding distractions, you can indulge in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">micro-distractions</mark> that are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">within the attention span of your traction, like staring through the window</mark>, changing your position, taking a mindful sip of a drink. Micro-distractions are not disruptions to your traction (i.e., not social media, another complex task, etc.). Micro-distractions <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">do two things</mark>:

* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Free up your attentional space</mark> for a few moments. This affords you a tiny break from mental effort.
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Give your mind the dopamine boost that comes with shifting your attention to something new</mark>. At the same time, they don't take it too far from what you're focusing on.

#### Attention Overwhelm

#attention-overwhelm #psychological-detachment  #helpful-distractions  #task-rituals

Problem:
* when you <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">overuse your attention</mark> at its [full capacity](#Attentional%20Space), it becomes depleted.
	* This happens by doing too many things at once or focusing on something complex for too long.

Solutions:

Regarding [tractions](#Traction%20and%20Distraction), <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">break down</mark> a complex task into smaller chunks that fit comfortably into your [attentional space](#Attentional%20Space).

Also, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">prevent</mark> [attentional residue](#Managing%20Your%20Attentional%20Space) with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opening and closing rituals</mark> (examples [here](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-design-3-personal-rituals-for-grounding-letting-go-and-recalibrating-c9d6d4236441));

* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">You need to clearly distinguish when you're focusing on traction and when you're not</mark>; [psychological detachment from work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721411434979)¬†is key to sustained productivity. 

Regarding distractions, monitor them with [meta-awareness](#Managing%20Your%20Attentional%20Space) (by constantly asking "where is my attention right now?").

Also, use meta-awareness to see if these distraction can be considered as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">helpful distractions</mark> that indicate more important needs that need to be tended to right now, like sleeping when you feel pain in your eyes, which in turn help in long-term productivity. Ask yourself the following to identify a distraction is helpful or not:

* Is the distraction coming because I've written enough and I'm tired ‚Äî or is it because I haven't fully engaged with the task?
- If I <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">disregard the distraction</mark> right now, how likely is it I'll be able to <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">return to full-focus mode in the next five minutes?</mark>
- Is my attentional space filled to the brim right now ‚Äî or is there spare room for the meta-awareness of my task?


#### Emotional Discomfort

#emotional-dicomfort  #reinforcement-theory-of-motivation  #the-white-bear-problem  #ironic-process-theory  #urge-surfing

Problem:
* Uncomfortable feelings, like not understanding the task required or not having a goal, are mitigated by indulging in distractions while we're trying to stay attentive on a current task.

Solutions:

Regarding [tractions](#Traction%20and%20Distraction), <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">focus on getting through the first 5-10 minutes</mark>.
* Example: When you start a coding project, tell yourself it's ok to spend some time just writing the business-requiremenets.txt file and/or searching for useful libraries, and it's ok not to accomplish much in that first session of work. 
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Remember: the goal is not to achieve tangible outcomes from the get-go, but to just get past that initial emotional barrier</mark>.

Also, use positive reinforcement to get back on track;
* You know that negative self-talk that happens when you lose focus? Convert that to positive self-talk :].
* For example, you can either beat yourself up for failing at focus, or you can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">congratulate yourself for remembering to get back on track</mark> (I never thought about it that way :]).
* The reason behind this is perfectly explained by the author Marta Brzosko (and [is called](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/reinforcement-theory-motivation.htm) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reinforcement theory of motivation</mark>), so I'll just quote her: 
> Catching yourself distracted is registered as something good because it allows you to get back on track. This way, you prime your brain to repeat this behavior in the future. On the other hand, if you beat yourself up, this is registered as an emotionally negative event. As a consequence, your brain will be less inclined to repeat it. This means the next time you get distracted, it may be harder to go back to traction.

Regarding distractions, when a difficult-to-resist distraction occurs (e.g., an old habit), <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">don't say to yourself</mark> "I won't think of this distraction" or "I will never do this distraction again!", as you'll become a prey to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"the white bear problem"</mark> (more formally, the [ironic process theory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ironic_process_theory) (IPC)).

Instead, give your full attention to this distraction for a few minutes by doing the following:
* For Muslims: Perform [suitable](https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/20538#:~:text=%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%91%D9%8E%D9%87%D9%85%D9%91%D9%8E%20%D8%A5%D9%86%D9%91%D9%90%D9%8A%20%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%8F%D9%83%D9%8E%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8F%D8%AF%D9%89%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%91%D9%8F%D9%82%D9%89%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%8E%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8E%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%90%D9%86%D9%89) Islamic ad'iyah.
* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Don't make any promises</mark> regarding ***not*** following this distraction.
	* In other words, intentionally deceive your mind that you will do whatever you want after an "x" amount of time. 
		* Note: you **have to actually believe** this. In other words, become the greatest actor of all time :].
		* This requires a lot of training in my opinion, but it **is** achievable.
* During an "x" amount of time, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">take 10 mindful breaths</mark>.
	* A mindful breath means turning your full attention to the physical sensations feel while having the urge to follow this distraction. This is called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">urge surfing</mark> (more info [here](https://gye.vids.io/videos/4c9adbb11d15e3c8c4/03-urge-surfing), [here](https://modlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/UrgeSurfing.pdf), and [here](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/urge-surfing-handout)).
* Increase the urge surfing time (i.e., "x") each time an old distraction habit comes up.
