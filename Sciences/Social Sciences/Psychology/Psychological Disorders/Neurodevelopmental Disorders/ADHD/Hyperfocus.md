# Definition

Hyperfocus refers to an intense fixation on an interest or activity for an extended period of time. People who experience hyperfocus often become so engrossed they block out the world around them ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=Hyperfocus%20refers%20to%20an%20intense%20fixation%20on%20an%20interest%20or%20activity%20for%20an%20extended%20period%20of%20time.%20People%20who%20experience%20hyperfocus%20often%20become%20so%20engrossed%20they%20block%20out%20the%20world%20around%20them.)).

More formally, it¬†is an intense form of¬†[mental](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mind "Mind")¬†[concentration](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention "Attention")¬†or¬†[visualization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Creative_visualization "Creative visualization")¬†that focuses¬†[consciousness](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Consciousness "Consciousness")¬†on a subject, topic, or task ([s1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus)). 

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Hyperfocus on a certain subject can cause side-tracking away from assigned or important tasks</mark>.

Psychiatrically, it is primarily considered to be a symptom (i.e., indication) of [ADHD](ADHD%20-%20Attention-Deficit%20Hyperactive%20Disorder.md)¬†together with inattention. It's also considered a trait of [other disorders](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus#:~:text=such%20as%20schizophrenia%2C%20and%20autism%20spectrum%20disorder%20(ASD).>).

It's a [negatively-connotated](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-negative-connotation-definition/#:~:text=First%2C%20let%E2%80%99s%20define%20negative%20connotation) synonym of [monotropic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monotropism) learning, which is the opposite of polytropic learning:

# Symptoms

From what I deduce, the following are indications of having hyperfocus disorder:
* Side-tracking away from assigned or important tasks due to concentration on other tasks or interests.
* Giving unplanned, unwanted, and extended period of time for an interesting task or topic. Examples:
	* For children, the object of hyperfocus¬†might be playing a video game or watching TV.
	* Adults might hyperfocus on social media or shopping.
		* In one extraordinary case history, cited by [Kathleen Nadeau](https://www.additudemag.com/author/kathleen-nadeau-ph-d/), a woman with ADHD was so focused on a project that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">she failed to notice that her house had caught fire</mark> üî•üèöÔ∏è ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=In%20one%20extraordinary%20case%20history%2C%20cited%20by%20Nadeau%2C%20a%20woman%20with%20ADHD%20was%20so%20focused%20on%20a%20project%20that%20she%20failed%20to%20notice%20that%20her%20house%20had%20caught%20fire.)).
	* whatever holds the attention, the result is the same: Unless something or someone interrupts, hours drift by as important tasks and relationships fall by the wayside.
* Difficulty of shifting attention from an interesting activity to a person talking to you ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=why%20you%20should%20allow%20a%20few%20minutes%20for%20the%20shift%20in%20attention%20to%20occur.%20It%E2%80%99s%20almost%20like%20pulling%20someone%20out%20of%20a%20dream.)) (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">It's as if you're getting pulled out of a dream</mark>).


# Causes

#dopamine 
#ÿßŸÑÿØŸàÿ®ÿßŸÖŸäŸÜ 

Hyperfocus is thought to result from the following:
* Abnormally low levels of dopamine
	* Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is particularly active in the brain‚Äôs frontal lobes.
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">This dopamine deficiency makes it hard to ‚Äúshift gears‚Äù to take up boring-but-necessary tasks</mark>.
	* Side note: this is also the case for [distractibility](https://www.additudemag.com/distractibility-not-just-an-adhd-thing/)
* The need of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a coping mechanism</mark> ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=such%20intense%20concentration%20is%20actually%20a%20coping%20mechanism.)).

# Training Your Hyperfocus

For adults with ADHD, managing bouts of hyperfocus requires setting up external cues to redirect their attention.
