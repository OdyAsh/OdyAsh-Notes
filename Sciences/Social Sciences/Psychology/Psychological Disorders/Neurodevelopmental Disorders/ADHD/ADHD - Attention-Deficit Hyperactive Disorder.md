# Definition

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a [neurodevelopmental disorder](NDDs%20-%20Neurodevelopmental%20Disorders.md) that impacts the parts of the brain that help us plan, focus on, and execute tasks ([s2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), [s3](https://github.com/mrseth01/awesome-adhd#:~:text=that%20impacts%20the%20parts%20of%20the%20brain%20that%20help%20us%20plan%2C%20focus%20on%2C%20and%20execute%20tasks.)). 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">ADHD is a difficulty in directing one's attention</mark> (an [executive function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Executive_function "Executive function") of the [frontal lobe](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Frontal_lobe "Frontal lobe")), <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">not a lack of attention</mark> ([s1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperfocus#:~:text=ADHD%20is%20a%20difficulty%20in%20directing%20one%27s%20attention)).

“People who think [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/) means having a short attention span misunderstand what ADHD is,” says [Kathleen Nadeau, Ph.D.](https://www.additudemag.com/author/kathleen-nadeau-ph-d/), “A better way to look at it is that people with ADHD have a ***dysregulated attention system***.” ([s2](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20who%20think,disregulated%20attention%20system.%E2%80%9D))

Note: ADHD is by some people [considered](https://www.curekids.org.nz/our-research/health-condition/neurological-and-neurodevelopmental-disorders#:~:text=Neurological%20and%20neurodevelopmental%20disorders%20are%20dysfunctions%20in%20part%20of%20the%20brain%20or%20nervous%20system%20that%20result%20in%20physical%20or%20psychological%20symptoms%20that%20can%20affect%20a%20child%E2%80%99s%20behaviour%2C%20memory%2C%20or%20ability%20to%20learn.%20Common%20neurological%20and%20neurodevelopmental%20disorders%20are) a [neurological disorder](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Neurological_disorder).

# Symptoms

[executive dysfunction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Executive_dysfunction "Executive dysfunction") and [emotional dysregulation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Emotional_dysregulation "Emotional dysregulation") are considered some of the core symptoms of ADHD ([s2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#:~:text=ADHD%20symptoms%20arise%20from%20executive%20dysfunction%2C%20and%20emotional%20dysregulation%20is%20often%20considered%20a%20core%20symptom.)).

Executive dysfunctions can cause the following:
* Inattention
* Hyperactivity (restlessness in adults)
* Impulsivity

Note: The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin. Some manuals like [DSM-5](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#:~:text=symptoms%20must%20be%20present%20for%20six%20months%20or%20more%20to%20a%20degree%20that%20is%20much%20greater) try to draw this line.

a lesser-known and more controversial symptom that some people with ADHD demonstrate is known as hyperfocus. Note that there are other conditions that include [hyperfocus](Hyperfocus.md) as a symptom, but here we are looking at hyperfocus as it relates to a person with ADHD ([s3](https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-symptoms-hyperfocus#:~:text=a%20lesser%2Dknown%20and%20more%20controversial%20symptom%20that%20some%20people%20with%20ADHD%20demonstrate%20is%20known%20as%20hyperfocus.%20Note%20that%20there%20are%20other%20conditions%20that%20include%20hyperfocus%20as%20a%20symptom%2C%20but%20here%20we%20will%20look%20at%20hyperfocus%20as%20it%20relates%20to%20a%20person%20with%20ADHD.)).

# Presentations

ADHD is divided into three primary presentations:

* predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)
* predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)
* combined presentation (ADHD-C).
